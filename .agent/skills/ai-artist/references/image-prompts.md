# Image Generation Prompts

> Techniques for Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Flux.

---

## Prompt Structure (Fixed Order)

```
[Subject] + [Style] + [Composition] + [Quality] + [Parameters]
```

**Order matters.** Subject first, model parameters last. Never rearrange.

## Subject Types

| Type | Example | Tips |
|------|---------|------|
| Portrait | "portrait of young woman with silver hair" | Describe features, expression, clothing |
| Product | "floating smartphone mockup" | Clean background, studio lighting |

| Abstract | "geometric patterns in motion" | Describe shapes, flow, color |
| Architecture | "brutalist concrete building" | Mention materials, era, setting |
| Food | "artisan sourdough bread on wooden board" | Describe texture, steam, props |

### Multi-Subject Rules

| # Subjects | Technique |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Direct description (best quality) |

## Negative Prompts (Stable Diffusion / Flux)

### Universal Negative

```
blurry, low quality, distorted, bad anatomy, watermark,
signature, text, cropped, out of frame, worst quality
```

### Domain-Specific Negatives

| Domain | Additional Negatives |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Portrait** | deformed face, extra fingers, mutated hands, bad proportions |
| **Product** | background clutter, text overlay, logo, shadow artifacts |
| **Architecture** | distorted perspective, floating elements, impossible geometry |
| **Food** | unappetizing, artificial look, oversaturated |

---

## Weighted Tokens (Stable Diffusion)

```
(keyword:1.3)   → Increase emphasis (1.0-1.5 range)
(keyword:0.7)   → Decrease emphasis (0.5-1.0 range)
[keyword]       → De-prioritize
```

### Weight Guidelines

| Weight | Effect | Use |
|--------|--------|-----|
| `1.0` | Normal | Default |
| `1.1-1.2` | Subtle boost | Ensure element appears |
| `1.3-1.5` | Strong boost | Make element dominant |
| `>1.5` | ⚠️ Artifacts | Avoid — causes distortion |
| `0.5-0.7` | Subtle reduce | Background element |

**Example:**

```
(cyberpunk:1.3), neon city at night, (rain reflections:1.2),
cinematic wide shot, volumetric fog, 8k render

Negative: blurry, low quality, text, watermark
```
