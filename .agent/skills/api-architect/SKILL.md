# API Architect

> Context-aware API design decisions. Learn to THINK about API style for THIS project, not default to REST.

---

## Prerequisites

**Required:** None — API Architect is a knowledge-based skill with no external dependencies.

**Optional:**
- `scripts/api_validator.ts` — run `node scripts/api_validator.ts <project_path>` for endpoint validation

---

## When to Use

| Situation | Reference |
|-----------|-----------|
| Choosing API style (REST/GraphQL/tRPC) | `rules/api-style.md` |
| Designing REST endpoints | `rules/rest.md` |
| Response format / error envelope | `rules/response.md` |
| GraphQL schema design | `rules/graphql.md` |
| tRPC for TypeScript fullstack | `rules/trpc.md` |
| API versioning strategy | `rules/versioning.md` |
| Auth pattern selection | `rules/auth.md` |
| Rate limiting strategy | `rules/rate-limiting.md` |
| OpenAPI documentation | `rules/documentation.md` |
| OWASP API security audit | `rules/security-testing.md` |
| Architecture review, contracts | `rules/engineering-spec.md` |

**Selective Reading Rule:** Read ONLY the file matching the current request. Do not read all files.

---

## System Boundaries

| Owned by This Skill | NOT Owned |
|---------------------|-----------|
| API style selection (REST/GraphQL/tRPC) | API implementation code (→ backend-specialist) |
| Response format and envelope design | Database schema (→ data-modeler) |
| Versioning strategy selection | Auth implementation (→ auth-patterns) |
| Rate limiting pattern selection | Security pen testing (→ security-scanner) |
| OWASP API Top 10 checklist | Infrastructure / deployment (→ server-ops) |
| OpenAPI documentation standards | Client-side consumption |

**Pure decision skill:** Produces design documents and specifications. Zero code generation, zero network calls.

---

## Execution Model — 4-Phase Lifecycle

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Classify** | Validate request type and project context | Validated input or error |
| **Evaluate** | Traverse decision tree (project_type → consumers → complexity → scale) | Selected pattern |
| **Enrich** | Attach checklist, anti-patterns, related decisions | Complete decision |
| **Emit** | Return structured output with rationale | Decision with metadata |

All phases synchronous. Decision tree ordering is fixed and deterministic.

---

## API Style Decision Tree

| Project Context | Recommended Style | Rationale |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| TypeScript monorepo, internal consumers only | **tRPC** | End-to-end type safety, zero serialization overhead |
| Complex relational data, multiple consumer types | **GraphQL** | Client-specific queries, no over-fetching |
| Public API, third-party consumers | **REST** | Widest compatibility, cacheable, well-understood |
| Simple CRUD, single consumer | **REST** | Minimal complexity, HTTP semantics sufficient |
| Real-time data requirements | **GraphQL** (subscriptions) or **WebSocket** | Native subscription support |

**Constraint:** `existing_api` context field takes precedence — avoid mixing styles unless justified.

---

## Error Taxonomy

| Code | Recoverable | Trigger |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | No | Request type not one of the 8 supported types |
| `ERR_MISSING_CONTEXT` | Yes | Required context field is null or empty |
| `ERR_CONSTRAINT_CONFLICT` | Yes | Contradictory constraints in input |
| `ERR_INVALID_CONSUMER` | Yes | Consumer type not recognized |
| `ERR_REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` | No | Rule file missing from rules/ directory |
| `ERR_VALIDATOR_FAILED` | Yes | api_validator.ts exited with non-zero code |
| `ERR_INVALID_SCALE` | No | Scale not one of: prototype, startup, growth, enterprise |

**Zero internal retries.** Deterministic output; same context = same decision.

---

## Decision Checklist

Before designing an API, confirm:

- [ ] **Consumers identified?** (web-spa, mobile, third-party, internal-service, cli)
- [ ] **API style chosen for THIS context?** (REST/GraphQL/tRPC — not defaulted)
- [ ] **Response envelope format defined?** (consistent across all endpoints)
- [ ] **Versioning strategy selected?** (URI/Header/Query — before first endpoint)
- [ ] **Auth pattern selected?** (JWT/OAuth/Passkey/API Key)
- [ ] **Rate limiting strategy defined?** (token bucket/sliding window)
- [ ] **OpenAPI documentation approach set?**
- [ ] **OWASP API Top 10 reviewed?**

---

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|-------|
| Default to REST for every project | Choose API style based on project context |
| Use verbs in REST endpoints (`/getUsers`) | Use resource nouns (`/users`) with HTTP methods |
| Different response formats per endpoint | Define one envelope pattern, apply uniformly |
| Expose internal error details to clients | Map internal errors to safe client-facing codes |
| Skip rate limiting on public APIs | Define rate limits before deployment |
| Version after breaking changes occur | Define versioning strategy before first endpoint |
