# 🏛️ PikaKit Architecture Doctrine  
**(System Architecture & Boundary Law)**

This doctrine defines the **architectural laws** governing how PikaKit is
structured, scaled, and evolved.

Architecture exists to:
- Prevent silent data corruption
- Prevent system-wide inconsistency
- Prevent “working but wrong” systems

If architecture is violated,  
the system may appear functional — **but it is already broken**.

---

## 1. Architectural Intent

PikaKit is a **data-trust platform**, not a feature-driven application.

The architecture prioritizes:
- Correctness over speed
- Predictability over flexibility
- Explicit ownership over convenience

Any design that obscures ownership  
is architecturally invalid.

---

## 2. System Boundary Law (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The system is divided into **strict, enforceable boundaries**:

### Backend
- Source of truth
- Data ingestion and normalization
- Persistence and aggregation
- Cost, rate-limit, and integrity control

### Frontend
- Rendering and presentation
- User interaction
- Visual state only
- NO truth ownership

### External Systems
- Untrusted dependencies
- Volatile availability
- Never authoritative

Crossing these boundaries **without mediation**
is an architectural violation.

---

## 3. Single Source of Truth Law

Every piece of **critical data** MUST have:

- One authoritative owner
- One normalization path
- One persistence strategy

Multiple truths are worse than missing data.

Client-side arbitration of truth  
is strictly forbidden.

---

---

## 4. Dependency Direction Law

Dependencies MUST flow **inward** toward the core:
External Services
        ↓
     Backend
        ↓
     Frontend

The frontend MUST NEVER:
- Depend directly on external APIs (production)
- Reconstruct backend meaning
- Patch missing data

If the frontend can “fix” backend data,  
the architecture is invalid.

---

## 5. Scalability Invariants

Scalability is a **first-order architectural property**,  
not a later optimization.

The system MUST:
- Scale users independently of external dependencies
- Absorb traffic spikes without amplification
- Fail gracefully under partial outages
- Preserve data correctness under load

If scaling requires architectural rewrite,  
the original design is invalid.

---

## 6. Evolution Without Erosion Law

Architecture may evolve,  
but MUST NOT erode.

### Allowed Evolution
- Additive extensions
- Explicit migrations
- Backward-compatible improvements

### Forbidden Evolution
- Layering exceptions
- Feature-driven shortcuts
- “Temporary” architecture without removal plans
- Accumulating special cases

Erosion is failure by accumulation.

---

## 7. Architectural Anti-Patterns (ZERO TOLERANCE)

The following are considered **architectural violations**:

- Blurred or shared data ownership
- Feature-specific architecture
- Client-side truth decisions
- Hidden coupling between layers
- Implicit contracts
- Architecture that relies on “tribal knowledge”

These patterns must be **rejected**, not mitigated.

---

## 8. Enforcement Rule

Any design or implementation that:

- Violates a system boundary
- Obscures data ownership
- Introduces implicit coupling
- Requires special context to be safe

**MUST be rejected**, regardless of delivery pressure.

---

## Final Authority

This doctrine overrides:
- Feature requirements
- Framework defaults
- Tooling constraints
- Short-term optimization goals

PikaKit architecture exists to protect:

**Long-term trust · Correctness · Scalability**

Not developer convenience.
