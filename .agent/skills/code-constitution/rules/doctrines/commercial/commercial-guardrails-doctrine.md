# 💼 PikaKit Commercial Guardrails Doctrine  
**(Enterprise Safety · Risk · Business Continuity Law)**

This doctrine defines the **commercial and enterprise guardrails**
governing how PikaKit evolves in production.

At scale,  
**technical mistakes become business failures**.

This doctrine exists to protect:
- User trust
- Legal exposure
- Revenue continuity
- Operational stability

---

## 1. Commercial Risk Philosophy

PikaKit assumes:

- Long-lived systems
- Paying users
- Large and distributed teams
- Regulatory and reputational exposure

Therefore:

- Safety outweighs speed
- Predictability outweighs experimentation
- Reversibility outweighs optimization

A slower correct system  
outperforms a fast broken one.

---

## 2. Change Classification Law (MANDATORY)

Every non-trivial change MUST be explicitly classified as one of:

### Non-Breaking Change
- Backward-compatible
- Behavior-preserving
- No user-visible risk

### Breaking Change
- Alters external behavior, APIs, or data contracts
- Requires migration or user adaptation

### Risk-Bearing Change
- Affects correctness, trust, compliance, or revenue
- Has non-obvious failure modes

Unclassified changes are treated as  
**HIGH RISK BY DEFAULT**.

---

## 3. Breaking Change Law (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Breaking changes are **FORBIDDEN** unless **ALL** conditions are met:

- A documented migration path exists
- Backward compatibility is preserved during transition
- Rollback is technically feasible
- Blast radius is explicitly understood
- Stakeholders are informed in advance

“If it compiles” or “tests pass”  
is NOT sufficient justification.

---

## 4. Speculative Change Prohibition

Speculative changes are **STRICTLY FORBIDDEN** in production systems.

Speculative includes:

- Refactors without measurable benefit
- Architectural rewrites “for cleanliness”
- Optimizations without proven bottlenecks
- Technology swaps driven by novelty

Every approved change MUST justify:

- Why now
- Why this approach
- Why the risk is acceptable

Curiosity is not a business strategy.

---

## 5. Blast Radius Awareness Law

Before approval, the impact of a change MUST be explicitly understood:

- Who is affected
- How many users are affected
- What data is at risk
- What revenue or trust is at risk
- How rollback is performed

If blast radius cannot be bounded,  
the change MUST NOT proceed.

---

## 6. Governance & Escalation Order

When trade-offs exist between:

- Safety vs speed
- Stability vs innovation
- Correctness vs delivery

Decisions MUST defer in this order:

1. PikaKit Master Constitution
2. Architecture Doctrine
3. Commercial Guardrails (this document)
4. Performance Doctrine
5. Review Checklists
6. Agent Enforcement Protocol
7. Developer or Agent Preference

Anything lower **cannot override** anything higher.

---

## 7. Commercial Anti-Patterns (ZERO TOLERANCE)

The following are considered **commercial violations**:

- Silent behavior changes
- Breaking APIs without deprecation
- Irreversible migrations
- Unbounded experiments in production
- “We’ll fix it later” reasoning
- Launching without rollback paths

If detected, changes MUST be **REVERTED IMMEDIATELY**.

---

## 8. Enforcement Rule

Any change that:

- Risks user trust
- Weakens legal or compliance posture
- Introduces irreversible state
- Trades correctness for delivery speed

**MUST NOT BE MERGED OR DEPLOYED**.

Missed deadlines are recoverable.  
Lost trust is not.

---

## Final Authority

This doctrine overrides:

- Feature enthusiasm
- Engineering curiosity
- Short-term delivery pressure
- Experimental ambition

PikaKit protects:

**Trust · Stability · Business Continuity**

Because **trust is the business**.
