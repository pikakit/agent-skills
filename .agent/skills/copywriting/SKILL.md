# Copywriting — Conversion Formulas

> 6 proven formulas. Benefit-first. Specific claims. One CTA per piece.

---

## 5 Must-Ask Questions (Socratic Gate)

| # | Question | Options |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | Target Audience? | Demographics / Pain points / Role |
| 2 | Core Product Value? | Primary benefit / USP |
| 3 | Content Type? | Landing / Email / Ad / Headline |
| 4 | Primary CTA? | Buy / Sign Up / Read More |
| 5 | Brand Tone? | Professional / Casual / Urgent |

---

## Prerequisites

**Required:** None — Copywriting is a knowledge-based skill with no external dependencies.

---

## When to Use

| Content Type | Formula | Steps |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Landing pages, ads | **AIDA** | Attention → Interest → Desire → Action |
| Email, sales pages | **PAS** | Problem → Agitate → Solution |
| Testimonials, case studies | **BAB** | Before → After → Bridge |
| Long-form sales | **4Ps** | Promise → Picture → Proof → Push |
| Headlines | **4Us** | Urgent + Unique + Useful + Ultra-specific |
| Product descriptions | **FAB** | Feature → Advantage → Benefit |

**Selection is deterministic:** same content type = same formula, every time.

---

## System Boundaries

| Owned by This Skill | NOT Owned |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Formula selection per content type | SEO keyword research (→ seo-optimizer) |
| Headline validation (4Us) | Visual design (→ studio) |
| Copy validation (5 rules) | A/B test infrastructure |
| Anti-pattern detection | Image generation for ads (→ ai-artist) |

**Pure decision skill:** Produces formula frameworks and validation. Zero side effects.

| **U**seful | What's the benefit? | Binary |
| **U**ltra-specific | What exactly? | Binary |

```
❌ "Our Product is Great"           → 0/4 Us
✅ "Cut Build Time by 73% in 48 Hours" → 4/4 Us
```

## Copy Validation Rules (5 Rules)

| # | Rule | Check |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | Benefit-first | Benefits precede features |
| 2 | Single CTA | One call-to-action per piece |
| 3 | Specific claims | Numbers, percentages, or concrete outcomes |
| 4 | No jargon | Conversational tone over corporate language |
| 5 | Read-aloud test | No awkward phrasing when spoken |

---

## Error Taxonomy

| Code | Recoverable | Trigger |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_MISSING_CONTENT_TYPE` | Yes | Content type not provided |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_CONTENT_TYPE` | No | Content type not in supported list |
| `ERR_MISSING_DRAFT` | Yes | Draft required for validation |
| `ERR_EMPTY_DRAFT` | Yes | Draft is empty |

**Zero internal retries.** Deterministic; same inputs = same output.

---

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|-------|
| Features first | Benefits first |
| Multiple CTAs | One clear action |
| Vague claims ("faster") | Specific numbers ("73% faster") |
| Corporate jargon | Conversational tone |

---

## Audit Logging (OpenTelemetry)

| Event | Metadata Payload | Severity |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| `formula_selected` | `{"formula": "PAS", "content_type": "email"}` | `INFO` |
| `validation_passed` | `{"content_type": "headline", "score": "4/4"}` | `INFO` |
| `violations_found` | `{"rule": "benefit-first", "severity": "error"}` | `WARN` |

All copywriting outputs MUST emit `formula_selected`, `validation_passed`, or `violations_found` events when applicable.
