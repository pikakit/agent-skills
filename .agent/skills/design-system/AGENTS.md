# Design System — UI Design Decisions

> Every pixel has purpose. Restraint is luxury. User psychology drives decisions.

---

## Prerequisites

**Required:** None — Design System is a knowledge-based skill with no external dependencies.

---

## When to Use

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Color selection | Invoke color-palette; read `rules/color-system.md` |
| Typography | Invoke typography-system; read `rules/typography-system.md` |
| Visual effects | Invoke visual-effect; read `rules/visual-effects.md` |
| Animation/motion | Invoke animation-select; read `rules/animation-guide.md` |
| UX validation | Invoke ux-audit; read `rules/ux-psychology.md` |
| Design decisions | Read `rules/decision-trees.md` |
| Architecture review | Read `rules/engineering-spec.md` |

---

## System Boundaries

| Owned by This Skill | NOT Owned |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Color theory (3 harmony types + semantic palette) | CSS/Tailwind generation (→ tailwind-kit) |
| Typography system (max 2 families, modular scale) | AI style recommendations (→ studio) |
| Visual effects selection criteria | Component implementation |
| Animation principles (3 functional categories) | WCAG accessibility (→ web-design-guidelines) |
| UX psychology audit (Hick's, Fitts's, Gestalt) | Image/asset generation (→ ai-artist) |
| 3 design anti-pattern bans | Frontend code architecture (→ frontend-design) |

**Pure decision skill:** Produces design specifications. Zero side effects (except UX audit script reads files).

---

## ⚠️ Anti-Pattern Bans (Enforced on ALL Outputs)

| # | Ban | Reason |
|---|-----|--------|
| 1 | **Purple Ban** | Do not use generic purple themes (AI-generated cliché) |
| 2 | **Bento Ban** | Do not default to Bento grids without explicit justification |
| 3 | **Dark Mode Default** | Do not assume dark mode unless `dark_mode_requested = true` |

---

## Color System (Quick Reference)

| Project + Mood | Harmony |
|---------------|---------|
| Professional / Corporate | Complementary |
| Creative / Playful | Triadic |
| Minimal / Luxury | Analogous |

Every palette includes: primary, secondary, accent, 5 neutrals, 4 semantic (success/warning/error/info).

---

## Typography Rules

| Rule | Constraint |
|------|-----------|
| Max font families | 2 (heading + body) |
| Scale | Modular ratio (1.25 or 1.333) |
| Line height | 1.4–1.6 for body text |

---

## Animation Categories

| Category | Purpose | Duration |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Feedback** | Confirm user action | 100–200ms |
| **Orientation** | Guide spatial awareness | 200–400ms |
| **Continuity** | Connect state transitions | 300–500ms |

Every animation must serve one of these 3 functions. Decorative-only motion is not allowed.

---

## Studio Integration

```bash
# Generate complete design system
node .agent/skills/studio/scripts/search.ts "<query>" --design-system

# Search specific domain
node .agent/skills/studio/scripts/search.ts "<query>" --domain style
```

**Available domains:** style, color, typography, landing, ux, chart, product

## Detailed Rules

### Rule: animation-guide

---
name: animation-guide
description: Animation principles — duration psychology, easing, micro-interactions, loading states, scroll animations
---

# Animation Guidelines Reference

> Animation principles and timing psychology - learn to decide, not copy.
> **No fixed durations to memorize - understand what affects timing.**

---

## 1. Duration Principles

### What Affects Timing

```
Factors that determine animation speed:
├── DISTANCE: Further travel = longer duration
├── SIZE: Larger elements = slower animations
├── COMPLEXITY: Complex = slower to process
├── IMPORTANCE: Critical actions = clear feedback
└── CONTEXT: Urgent = fast, luxurious = slow
```

### Duration Ranges by Purpose

| Purpose | Range | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Instant feedback | 50-100ms | Below perception threshold |
| Micro-interactions | 100-200ms | Quick but noticeable |
| Standard transitions | 200-300ms | Comfortable pace |
| Complex animations | 300-500ms | Time to follow |
| Page transitions | 400-600ms | Smooth handoff |
| **Wow/Premium Effects** | 800ms+ | Dramatic, organic spring-based, layered |

### Choosing Duration

Ask yourself:
1. How far is the element moving?
2. How important is it to notice this change?
3. Is the user waiting, or is this background?

---

## 2. Easing Principles

### What Easing Does

```
Easing = how speed changes over time
├── Linear: constant speed (mechanical, robotic)
├── Ease-out: fast start, slow end (natural entry)
├── Ease-in: slow start, fast end (natural exit)
└── Ease-in-out: slow both ends (smooth, deliberate)
```

### When to Use Each

| Easing | Best For | Feels Like |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Ease-out** | Elements entering | Arriving, settling |
| **Ease-in** | Elements leaving | Departing, exiting |
| **Ease-in-out** | Emphasis, loops | Deliberate, smooth |
| **Linear** | Continuous motion | Mechanical, constant |
| **Bounce/Elastic** | Playful UI | Fun, energetic |

### The Pattern

```css
/* Entering view = ease-out (decelerate) */
.enter {
  animation-timing-function: ease-out;
}

/* Leaving view = ease-in (accelerate) */
.exit {
  animation-timing-function: ease-in;
}

/* Continuous = ease-in-out */
.continuous {
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}
```

---

## 3. Micro-Interaction Principles

### What Makes Good Micro-Interactions

```
Purpose of micro-interactions:
├── FEEDBACK: Confirm the action happened
├── GUIDANCE: Show what's possible
├── STATUS: Indicate current state
└── DELIGHT: Small moments of joy
```

### Button States

```
Hover → slight visual change (lift, color, scale)
Active → pressed feeling (scale down, shadow change)
Focus → clear indicator (outline, ring)
Loading → progress indicator (spinner, skeleton)
Success → confirmation (check, color)
```

### Principles

1. **Respond immediately** (under 100ms perception)
2. **Match the action** (press = `scale(0.95)`, hover = `translateY(-4px) + glow`)
3. **Be bold but smooth** (Usta işi hissettir)
4. **Be consistent** (same actions = same feedback)

---

## 4. Loading States Principles

### Types by Context

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Quick load (<1s) | No indicator needed |
| Medium (1-3s) | Spinner or simple animation |
| Long (3s+) | Progress bar or skeleton |
| Unknown duration | Indeterminate indicator |

### Skeleton Screens

```
Purpose: Reduce perceived wait time
├── Show layout shape immediately
├── Animate subtly (shimmer, pulse)
├── Replace with content when ready
└── Feels faster than spinner
```

### Progress Indicators

```
When to show progress:
├── User-initiated action
├── File uploads/downloads
├── Multi-step processes
└── Long operations

When NOT needed:
├── Very quick operations
├── Background tasks
└── Initial page loads (skeleton better)
```

---

## 5. Page Transitions Principles

### Transition Strategy

```
Simple rule: exit fast, enter slower
├── Outgoing content fades quickly
├── Incoming content animates in
└── Avoids "everything moving at once"
```

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fade** | Safe default, works everywhere |
| **Slide** | Sequential navigation (prev/next) |
| **Scale** | Opening/closing modals |
| **Shared element** | Maintaining visual continuity |

### Direction Matching

```
Navigation direction = animation direction
├── Forward → slide from right
├── Backward → slide from left
├── Deeper → scale up from center
├── Back up → scale down
```

---

## 6. Scroll Animation Principles

### Progressive Reveal

```
Content appears as user scrolls:
├── Reduces initial cognitive load
├── Rewards exploration
├── Must not feel sluggish
└── Option to disable (accessibility)
```

### Trigger Points

| When to Trigger | Effect |
|-----------------|--------|
| Just entering viewport | Standard reveal |
| Centered in viewport | For emphasis |
| Partially visible | Earlier reveal |
| Fully visible | Late trigger |

### Animation Properties

- Fade in (opacity)
- Slide up (transform)
- Scale (transform)
- Combination of above

### Performance

- Use Intersection Observer
- Animate only transform/opacity
- Reduce on mobile if needed

---

## 7. Hover Effects Principles

### Matching Effect to Action

| Element | Effect | Intent |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Clickable card** | Lift + shadow | "This is interactive" |
| **Button** | Color/brightness change | "Press me" |
| **Image** | Zoom/scale | "View closer" |
| **Link** | Underline/color | "Navigate here" |

### Principles

1. **Signal interactivity** - hover shows it's clickable
2. **Don't overdo it** - subtle changes work
3. **Match importance** - bigger change = more important
4. **Touch alternatives** - hover doesn't work on mobile

---

## 8. Feedback Animation Principles

### Success States

```
Celebrate appropriately:
├── Minor action → subtle check/color
├── Major action → more pronounced animation
├── Completion → satisfying animation
└── Match brand personality
```

### Error States

```
Draw attention without panic:
├── Color change (semantic red)
├── Shake animation (brief!)
├── Focus on error field
└── Clear messaging
```

### Timing

- Success: slightly longer (enjoy the moment)
- Error: quick (don't delay action)
- Loading: continuous until complete

---

## 9. Performance Principles

### What's Cheap to Animate

```
GPU-accelerated (FAST):
├── transform: translate, scale, rotate
└── opacity: 0 to 1

CPU-intensive (SLOW):
├── width, height
├── top, left, right, bottom
├── margin, padding
├── border-radius changes
└── box-shadow changes
```

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Animate transform/opacity** whenever possible
2. **Avoid layout triggers** (size/position changes)
3. **Use will-change sparingly** (hints to browser)
4. **Test on low-end devices** (not just dev machine)

### Respecting User Preferences

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Honor this preference */
  /* Essential animations only */
  /* Reduce or remove decorative motion */
}
```

---

## 10. Animation Decision Checklist

Before adding animation:

- [ ] **Is there a purpose?** (feedback/guidance/delight)
- [ ] **Is timing appropriate?** (not too fast/slow)
- [ ] **Did you pick correct easing?** (enter/exit/emphasis)
- [ ] **Is it performant?** (transform/opacity only)
- [ ] **Tested reduced motion?** (accessibility)
- [ ] **Consistent with other animations?** (same timing feel)
- [ ] **Not your default settings?** (variety check)
- [ ] **Asked user about style if unclear?**

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Same timing values every project
- ❌ Animation for animation's sake
- ❌ Ignoring reduced-motion preference
- ❌ Animating expensive properties
- ❌ Too many things animating at once
- ❌ Delays that frustrate users

---

> **Remember**: Animation is communication. Every motion should have meaning and serve the user experience.

                  ╲       ╱
                    BLUE
```

### Color Relationships

| Scheme | How to Create | When to Use |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Monochromatic** | Pick ONE hue, vary only lightness/saturation | Minimal, professional, cohesive |
| **Analogous** | Pick 2-3 ADJACENT hues on wheel | Harmonious, calm, nature-inspired |
| **Complementary** | Pick OPPOSITE hues on wheel | High contrast, vibrant, attention |
| **Split-Complementary** | Base + 2 colors adjacent to complement | Dynamic but balanced |
| **Triadic** | 3 hues EQUIDISTANT on wheel | Vibrant, playful, creative |

### How to Choose a Scheme:
1. **What's the project mood?** Calm → Analogous. Bold → Complementary.
2. **How many colors needed?** Minimal → Monochromatic. Complex → Triadic.
3. **Who's the audience?** Conservative → Monochromatic. Young → Triadic.

## 2. The 60-30-10 Rule

### Distribution Principle
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                 │
│     60% PRIMARY (Background, large areas)       │
│     → Should be neutral or calming              │
│     → Carries the overall tone                  │
│                                                 │
├────────────────────────────────────┬────────────┤
│                                    │            │
│   30% SECONDARY                    │ 10% ACCENT │
│   (Cards, sections, headers)       │ (CTAs,     │
│   → Supports without dominating    │ highlights)│
│                                    │ → Draws    │
│                                    │   attention│
└────────────────────────────────────┴────────────┘
```

### Implementation Pattern
```css
:root {
  /* 60% - Pick based on light/dark mode and mood */
  --color-bg: /* neutral: white, off-white, or dark gray */
  --color-surface: /* slightly different from bg */
  
  /* 30% - Pick based on brand or context */
  --color-secondary: /* muted version of primary or neutral */
  
  /* 10% - Pick based on desired action/emotion */
  --color-accent: /* vibrant, attention-grabbing */
}
```

## 3. Color Psychology - Meaning & Selection

### How to Choose Based on Context

| If Project Is... | Consider These Hues | Why |
|------------------|---------------------|-----|
| **Finance, Tech, Healthcare** | Blues, Teals | Trust, stability, calm |
| **Eco, Wellness, Nature** | Greens, Earth tones | Growth, health, organic |
| **Food, Energy, Youth** | Orange, Yellow, Warm | Appetite, excitement, warmth |
| **Luxury, Beauty, Creative** | Deep Teal, Gold, Black | Sophistication, premium |
| **Urgency, Sales, Alerts** | Red, Orange | Action, attention, passion |

### Emotional Associations (For Decision Making)

| Hue Family | Positive Associations | Cautions |
|------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Blue** | Trust, calm, professional | Can feel cold, corporate |
| **Green** | Growth, nature, success | Can feel boring if overused |
| **Red** | Passion, urgency, energy | High arousal, use sparingly |
| **Orange** | Warmth, friendly, creative | Can feel cheap if saturated |
| **Purple** | ⚠️ **BANNED** - AI overuses this! | Use Deep Teal/Maroon/Emerald instead |
| **Yellow** | Optimism, attention, happy | Hard to read, use as accent |
| **Black** | Elegance, power, modern | Can feel heavy |
| **White** | Clean, minimal, open | Can feel sterile |

### Selection Process:
1. **What industry?** → Narrow to 2-3 hue families
2. **What emotion?** → Pick primary hue
3. **What contrast?** → Decide light vs dark mode
4. **ASK USER** → Confirm before proceeding

---

## 4. Palette Generation Principles

### From a Single Color (HSL Method)

Instead of memorizing hex codes, learn to **manipulate HSL**:

```
HSL = Hue, Saturation, Lightness

Hue (0-360): The color family
  0/360 = Red
  60 = Yellow
  120 = Green
  180 = Cyan
  240 = Blue
  300 = Purple

Saturation (0-100%): Color intensity
  Low = Muted, sophisticated
  High = Vibrant, energetic

Lightness (0-100%): Brightness
  0% = Black
  50% = Pure color
  100% = White
```

### Generating a Full Palette

Given ANY base color, create a scale:

```
Lightness Scale:
  50  (lightest) → L: 97%
  100            → L: 94%
  200            → L: 86%
  300            → L: 74%
  400            → L: 66%
  500 (base)     → L: 50-60%
  600            → L: 48%
  700            → L: 38%
  800            → L: 30%
  900 (darkest)  → L: 20%
```

### Saturation Adjustments

| Context | Saturation Level |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Professional/Corporate** | Lower (40-60%) |
| **Playful/Youth** | Higher (70-90%) |
| **Dark Mode** | Reduce by 10-20% |
| **Accessibility** | Ensure contrast, may need adjustment |

---

## 5. Context-Based Selection Guide

### Instead of Copying Palettes, Follow This Process:

**Step 1: Identify the Context**
```
What type of project?
├── E-commerce → Need trust + urgency balance
├── SaaS/Dashboard → Need low-fatigue, data focus
├── Health/Wellness → Need calming, natural feel
├── Luxury/Premium → Need understated elegance
├── Creative/Portfolio → Need personality, memorable
└── Other → ASK the user
```

**Step 2: Select Primary Hue Family**
```
Based on context, pick ONE:
- Blue family (trust)
- Green family (growth)
- Warm family (energy)
- Neutral family (elegant)
- OR ask user preference
```

**Step 3: Decide Light/Dark Mode**
```
Consider:
- User preference?
- Industry standard?
- Content type? (text-heavy = light preferred)
- Time of use? (evening app = dark option)
```

**Step 4: Generate Palette Using Principles**
- Use HSL manipulation
- Follow 60-30-10 rule
- Check contrast (WCAG)
- Test with actual content

---

## 6. Dark Mode Principles

### Key Rules (No Fixed Codes)

1. **Never pure black** → Use very dark gray with slight hue
2. **Never pure white text** → Use 87-92% lightness
3. **Reduce saturation** → Vibrant colors strain eyes in dark mode
4. **Elevation = brightness** → Higher elements slightly lighter

### Contrast in Dark Mode

```
Background layers (darker → lighter as elevation increases):
Layer 0 (base)    → Darkest
Layer 1 (cards)   → Slightly lighter
Layer 2 (modals)  → Even lighter
Layer 3 (popups)  → Lightest dark
```

### Adapting Colors for Dark Mode

| Light Mode | Dark Mode Adjustment |
|------------|---------------------|
| High saturation accent | Reduce saturation 10-20% |
| Pure white background | Dark gray with brand hue tint |
| Black text | Light gray (not pure white) |
| Colorful backgrounds | Desaturated, darker versions |

---

## 7. Accessibility Guidelines

### Contrast Requirements (WCAG)

| Level | Normal Text | Large Text |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| AA (minimum) | 4.5:1 | 3:1 |
| AAA (enhanced) | 7:1 | 4.5:1 |

### How to Check Contrast

1. **Convert colors to luminance**
2. **Calculate ratio**: (lighter + 0.05) / (darker + 0.05)
3. **Adjust until ratio meets requirement**

### Safe Patterns

| Use Case | Guideline |
|----------|-----------|
| **Text on light bg** | Use lightness 35% or less |
| **Text on dark bg** | Use lightness 85% or more |
| **Primary on white** | Ensure dark enough variant |
| **Buttons** | High contrast between bg and text |

---

## 8. Color Selection Checklist

Before finalizing any color choice, verify:

- [ ] **Asked user preference?** (if not specified)
- [ ] **Matches project context?** (industry, audience)
- [ ] **Follows 60-30-10?** (proper distribution)
- [ ] **WCAG compliant?** (contrast checked)
- [ ] **Works in both modes?** (if dark mode needed)
- [ ] **NOT your default/favorite?** (variety check)
- [ ] **Different from last project?** (avoid repetition)

---

## 9. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T:
- Copy the same hex codes every project
- Default to purple/violet (AI tendency)
- Default to dark mode + neon (AI tendency)
- Use pure black (#000000) backgrounds
- Use pure white (#FFFFFF) text on dark
- Ignore user's industry context
- Skip asking user preference

### ✅ DO:
- Generate fresh palette per project
- Ask user about color preferences
- Consider industry and audience
- Use HSL for flexible manipulation
- Test contrast and accessibility
- Offer light AND dark options

---

> **Remember**: Colors are decisions, not defaults. Every project deserves thoughtful selection based on its unique context.

### Rule: color-systems

---
name: color-systems
description: Color commitment strategy — dominant + accent + neutral, 4 aesthetic palettes, dark mode
---

# Color Systems

> Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.

---

## Principle: Commit Fully

Don't distribute color evenly. Choose:
- **1 dominant color** (60-70% of palette)
- **1 sharp accent** (10-20% for emphasis)
- **1-2 neutrals** (supporting roles)

---

## Color System Setup

```css
:root {
  /* Primary - dominant presence */
  --color-primary: #1A202C;
  --color-primary-light: #2D3748;
  --color-primary-dark: #0F1419;
  
  /* Accent - sharp, attention-grabbing */
  --color-accent: #F56565;
  --color-accent-hover: #E53E3E;
  
  /* Neutrals - supporting */
  --color-neutral-50: #FAFAFA;
  --color-neutral-100: #F5F5F5;
  --color-neutral-200: #E5E5E5;
  --color-neutral-300: #D4D4D4;
  --color-neutral-700: #525252;
  --color-neutral-900: #171717;
  
  /* Semantic */
  --color-success: #10B981;
  --color-warning: #F59E0B;
  --color-error: #EF4444;
}
```

---

## Aesthetic Palettes

### Dark + Bold Accent
```css
--color-bg: #0F0F0F;

## Dark Mode

```css
:root {
  --color-bg: #FAFAFA;
  --color-text: #1A1A1A;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --color-bg: #1A1A1A;
    --color-text: #FAFAFA;
  }
}

/* Or manual toggle */
[data-theme="dark"] {
  --color-bg: #1A1A1A;
  --color-text: #FAFAFA;
}

# Decision Trees & Context Templates

> Context-based design THINKING, not fixed solutions.
> **These are decision GUIDES, not copy-paste templates.**
> **For UX psychology principles (Hick's, Fitts', etc.) see:** [ux-psychology.md](ux-psychology.md)

---

## ⚠️ How to Use This File

This file helps you DECIDE, not copy.

- Decision trees → Help you THINK through options
- Templates → Show STRUCTURE and PRINCIPLES, not exact values
- **Always ask user preferences** before applying
- **Generate fresh palettes** based on context, don't copy hex codes
- **Apply UX laws** from ux-psychology.md to validate decisions

## 3. Color Selection Decision Tree

### Instead of fixed hex codes, use this process:

```
WHAT EMOTION/ACTION DO YOU WANT?
            │
            ├── Trust & Security
            │   └── Consider: Blue family, professional neutrals
            │       → ASK user for specific shade preference
            │
            ├── Growth & Health
            │   └── Consider: Green family, natural tones
            │       → ASK user if eco/nature/wellness focus
            │
            ├── Urgency & Action
            │   └── Consider: Warm colors (orange/red) as ACCENTS
            │       → Use sparingly, ASK if appropriate
            │
            ├── Luxury & Premium
            │   └── Consider: Deep darks, metallics, restrained palette
            │       → ASK about brand positioning
            │
            ├── Creative & Playful
            │   └── Consider: Multi-color, unexpected combinations
            │       → ASK about brand personality
            │
            └── Calm & Minimal
                └── Consider: Neutrals with single accent
                    → ASK what accent color fits brand
```

### The Process:
1. Identify the emotion needed
2. Narrow to color FAMILY
3. ASK user for preference within family
4. Generate fresh palette using HSL principles

## 5. E-commerce Guidelines {#e-commerce}

### Key Principles (Not Fixed Rules)
- **Trust first:** How will you show security?
- **Action-oriented:** Where are the CTAs?
- **Scannable:** Can users compare quickly?

### Color Thinking:
```
E-commerce typically needs:
├── Trust color (often blue family) → ASK preference
├── Clean background (white/neutral) → depends on brand
├── Action accent (for CTAs, sales) → depends on urgency level
├── Success/error semantics → standard conventions work
└── Brand integration → ASK about existing colors
```

### Layout Principles:
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HEADER: Brand + Search + Cart                      │
│  (Keep essential actions visible)                   │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  TRUST ZONE: Why trust this site?                   │
│  (Shipping, returns, security - if applicable)      │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  HERO: Primary message or offer                     │
│  (Clear CTA, single focus)                          │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CATEGORIES: Easy navigation                        │
│  (Visual, filterable, scannable)                    │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PRODUCTS: Easy comparison                          │
│  (Price, rating, quick actions visible)             │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  SOCIAL PROOF: Why others trust                     │
│  (Reviews, testimonials - if available)             │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  FOOTER: All the details                            │
│  (Policies, contact, trust badges)                  │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Psychology to Apply:
- Hick's Law: Limit navigation choices
- Fitts' Law: Size CTAs appropriately
- Social proof: Show where relevant
- Scarcity: Use honestly if at all

├── Fixed sidebar for navigation
└── Main area for content

OPTION B: Top nav + Content
├── Horizontal navigation
└── More horizontal content space

OPTION C: Collapsed + Expandable
├── Icon-only sidebar expands
└── Maximum content area

→ ASK user about their navigation preference
```

### Psychology to Apply:
- Hick's Law: Group navigation items
- Miller's Law: Chunk information
- Cognitive Load: Whitespace, consistency

---

## 7. Landing Page Guidelines {#landing-page}

### Key Principles
- **Hero-centric:** First impression matters most
- **Single focus:** One primary CTA

### Color Thinking:
```
Landing page typically needs:
├── Brand primary: Hero background or accent
├── Clean secondary: Most of page
├── CTA color: Stands out from everything
├── Supporting: For sections, testimonials
└── ASK about brand colors first!
```

└── ASK about personal brand identity!
```

### Structure Principles:
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Navigation: Unique to your personality             │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  INTRO: Who you are, what you do                   │
│  (Make it memorable, not generic)                   │

│  (Clear, direct)                                    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Psychology to Apply:

name: design-extraction
description: Screenshot analysis process — 4-step extract-document-implement-verify workflow
---

# Design Extraction from Screenshots

> Never jump straight to code. Analyze first.

---

## Extraction Process

```
Screenshot → Analyze → Document → Implement → Verify
```

### Step 1: Analyze Screenshot

Extract these elements:

| Category | What to Extract |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Colors** | All hex codes (primary, accent, neutral, background) |
| **Typography** | Font families, sizes, weights, line-heights |
| **Spacing** | Margin/padding patterns, spacing scale |
| **Layout** | Grid structure, flexbox patterns, positioning |
| **Components** | Button styles, card styles, form elements |
| **Visual** | Shadows, borders, gradients, textures |

---

### Step 2: Document Findings

Create `design-guidelines.md`:

```markdown
# Extracted Design System

## Colors
- Primary: #2D3748
- Accent: #ED8936
- Background: #F7FAFC
- Text: #1A202C

## Typography
### Headings
- Font: Playfair Display
- Sizes: 48px (h1), 32px (h2), 24px (h3)
- Weight: 700
- Line-height: 1.2

### Body
- Font: Source Sans Pro
- Size: 16px
- Weight: 400
- Line-height: 1.6

## Spacing Scale
- xs: 4px
- sm: 8px
- md: 16px
- lg: 24px
- xl: 32px
- 2xl: 48px

## Layout
- Max width: 1200px
- Grid: 12 columns
- Gutter: 24px

## Components
### Buttons
- Padding: 12px 24px
- Border-radius: 8px
- Font-weight: 600
```

---

### Step 3: Implement with Precision

```css
/* Match EXACT specifications */
:root {
  --color-primary: #2D3748;
  --color-accent: #ED8936;
  --color-background: #F7FAFC;
  
  --font-heading: 'Playfair Display', serif;
  --font-body: 'Source Sans Pro', sans-serif;
  
  --space-xs: 4px;
  --space-sm: 8px;
  --space-md: 16px;
  --space-lg: 24px;
  --space-xl: 32px;
}

.heading {
  font-family: var(--font-heading);
  font-size: 48px;
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1.2;
  color: var(--color-primary);
}
```

---

### Step 4: Verify Quality

Compare implementation to original:

| Check | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Colors** | Exact hex match |
| **Typography** | Font, size, weight, line-height |
| **Spacing** | Margins, padding consistent |
| **Layout** | Grid alignment, proportions |
| **Components** | Visual identical |
| **Responsiveness** | Same breakpoint behavior |

---

## Common Extraction Mistakes

| ❌ Mistake | ✅ Fix |
|-----------|-------|
| Guessing colors | Use eyedropper tool |
| Assuming fonts | Identify with WhatFont |
| Ignoring spacing | Measure precisely |
| Skipping small details | Note every shadow, border |
| One-off extraction | Create reusable system |

description: Full 21-section engineering spec — contracts, anti-slop enforcement, compliance matrix, production checklist
---

# Frontend Design — Engineering Specification

> Production-grade specification for distinctive frontend interface design decisions at FAANG scale.

---

## 1. Overview

Frontend Design provides structured decision frameworks for creating distinctive, production-grade web interfaces: aesthetic direction selection (5 styles), anti-AI-slop enforcement, design extraction from screenshots, typography pairing, color system commitment, and motion orchestration. The skill operates as an expert knowledge base with 5 reference files — it produces design direction decisions, aesthetic specifications, and implementation guidance. It does not write CSS, create components, or render UI.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Frontend design at scale faces four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Generic AI-generated UIs | 75% of AI-built interfaces use Inter + purple gradient + bento grid | Indistinguishable products |
| Timid color choices | 60% of projects use safe, muted palettes | No visual identity |
| Scattered animations | 45% of motion has no choreographic purpose | Visual noise, performance cost |
| Layout conformity | 70% of layouts follow identical card-grid patterns | No design differentiation |

Frontend Design eliminates these with bold aesthetic direction commitment, anti-AI-slop rules, and intentional design decisions.

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | Distinctive aesthetics | 1 of 5 committed directions; no "safe middle" |
| G2 | Anti-AI-slop | No generic fonts (Inter/Roboto alone), no pure RGB, no basic shadows |
| G3 | Bold typography | Display font + body font pairing; heading ≥ 48px |
| G4 | Committed color | Dominant primary + sharp accent; no more than 3 brand colors |
| G5 | Orchestrated motion | Single entrance sequence with staggered timing |
| G6 | Faithful reproduction | Screenshot → implementation match ≥ 95% accuracy |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | CSS/Tailwind code generation | Owned by `tailwind-kit` / caller |
| NG2 | Design token systems | Owned by `design-system` skill |
| NG3 | AI-powered style search | Owned by `studio` skill |
| NG4 | Asset/image generation | Owned by `ai-artist` skill |
| NG5 | Component architecture | Framework-specific concern |
| NG6 | WCAG accessibility | Owned by `web-design-guidelines` skill |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Aesthetic direction selection (5 styles) | Decision framework | CSS implementation |
| Anti-AI-slop enforcement (4 banned patterns) | Ban list and alternatives | Automated linting |
| Design extraction from screenshots | Extraction process (4 steps) | Screenshot capture |
| Typography pairing guidance | Font pair selection, sizing rules | Font loading |
| Color system commitment | Palette strategy (dominant + accent) | CSS custom properties |
| Motion orchestration | Choreography patterns | Animation library code |

**Side-effect boundary:** Frontend Design produces design decisions, aesthetic guidelines, and implementation specifications. It does not create files, write CSS, or render components.

#### Error Schema

```
Code: string                  # From Error Taxonomy (Section 11)
Message: string
Request_Type: string
Recoverable: boolean
```

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Same `brand_tone` = same aesthetic direction.
- Aesthetic selection is deterministic: tone → direction mapping is fixed.
- Anti-slop check uses fixed 4-ban list (generic fonts, pure RGB, basic shadows, scattered micro-interactions).
- Typography always pairs display + body font; heading minimum 48px.
- Color system always limits to 3 brand colors (dominant + accent + neutral).
- Motion always uses one orchestrated entrance pattern.

#### What Agents May Assume

- Aesthetic direction is committed (no "safe middle" options).
- Typography pairing is distinctive (not Inter/Roboto default).
- Color palette includes dominant, accent, and neutral.
- Anti-slop check covers all 4 banned AI patterns.

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- The skill generates CSS, HTML, or component code.
- Font files are available or loaded.
- Color values pass WCAG contrast requirements (→ web-design-guidelines).
- The skill creates design system tokens (→ design-system).

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| Aesthetic direction | None; decision output |
| Screenshot extract | None; analysis output |
| Typography guide | None; recommendation |
| Color system | None; palette specification |
| Motion guide | None; choreography recommendation |
| Anti-slop check | None; violation list |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Workflow 1: From Screenshots

```
1. Receive screenshot URL/path
2. Invoke screenshot-extract to analyze design
3. Document extracted specs (caller's responsibility)
4. Implement matching design (caller's responsibility)
5. Verify side-by-side (caller's responsibility)
```

#### Workflow 2: From Scratch

```
1. Define project type and brand tone
2. Invoke aesthetic-direction for committed style
3. Invoke typography-guide for font pairing
4. Invoke color-system for palette
5. Invoke motion-guide for choreography
6. Invoke anti-slop-check to validate decisions
7. Implement design (caller's responsibility)
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Each invocation produces a complete, self-contained recommendation.
- Anti-slop check can be invoked at any point for validation.

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Invalid request type | Return error to caller | Use supported type |
| Missing brand tone | Return error to caller | Supply brand tone |
| Anti-slop violation | Return violations status | Revise design choice |
| Screenshot not found | Return error to caller | Supply valid screenshot |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Zero internal retries. Deterministic output.

#### Isolation Model

- Each invocation is stateless and independent.

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Aesthetic direction | Yes | Same tone = same direction |
| Screenshot extract | Yes | Same screenshot = same analysis |
| Typography guide | Yes | Same context = same pairing |
| Color system | Yes | Same context = same palette |
| Motion guide | Yes | Same context = same choreography |
| Anti-slop check | Yes | Same input = same violations |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 3-Phase Lifecycle

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Parse** | Validate request type, brand tone, project type | Validated input or error |
| **Evaluate** | Traverse aesthetic decision tree; check anti-slop bans | Design recommendation |
| **Emit** | Return structured output with reference file link | Complete output schema |

All phases synchronous. No async pipeline.

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fixed aesthetic directions | 5 styles; no hybrid or "safe" options |
| Fixed anti-slop bans | 4 bans: generic fonts, pure RGB, basic shadows, scattered motion |
| Fixed typography minimum | Heading ≥ 48px; max 2 font families |
| Fixed color limit | Max 3 brand colors (dominant + accent + neutral) |
| Fixed motion rule | One orchestrated entrance; no scattered micro-interactions |
| Bold commitment | Every decision demands a committed direction |
| No external calls | All decisions based on embedded rules + reference files |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

Stateless. Fully idempotent. No persistent state.

Each invocation produces an identical output for identical inputs. No design history, no accumulated preferences.

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Unknown request type | Return `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Use supported type |
| Missing brand tone | Return `ERR_MISSING_BRAND_TONE` | Supply brand tone |
| Missing project type | Return `ERR_MISSING_PROJECT_TYPE` | Supply project type |
| Screenshot not found | Return `ERR_SCREENSHOT_NOT_FOUND` | Supply valid path |
| Anti-slop violation | Return `WARN_AI_SLOP` with violations | Revise design |
| Reference file missing | Return `ERR_REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` | Verify installation |

**Invariant:** Every failure returns a structured error. No silent fallback to "safe" defaults.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Validation | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_MISSING_BRAND_TONE` | Validation | Yes | Brand tone not provided |
| `ERR_MISSING_PROJECT_TYPE` | Validation | Yes | Project type not provided |
| `ERR_SCREENSHOT_NOT_FOUND` | Validation | Yes | Screenshot path invalid |
| `ERR_REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` | Infrastructure | No | Reference file missing |
| `WARN_AI_SLOP` | Design | Yes | Generic AI pattern detected |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Decision timeout | N/A | N/A | Synchronous; < 50ms |
| Internal retries | Zero | Zero | Deterministic output |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema

### Log Entry Format

```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "skill_name": "frontend-design",
  "contract_version": "2.0.0",
  "execution_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "request_type": "string",
  "brand_tone": "string|null",

  "anti_slop_violations": "number",
  "status": "success|violations|error",
  "error_code": "string|null",
  "duration_ms": "number"
}
```

### Required Log Points

| Event | Log Level | Fields |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Direction selected | INFO | aesthetic_direction, brand_tone |
| Anti-slop violation | WARN | pattern, alternative |
| Decision failed | ERROR | error_code, message |

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Unit |
|--------|------|------|
| `frontenddesign.decision.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `frontenddesign.direction.selected` | Counter | per direction |
| `frontenddesign.slop_violation.count` | Counter | per pattern |
| `frontenddesign.request_type.distribution` | Counter | per type |

---

## 14. Security & Trust Model

### Data Handling

- Frontend Design does not access user data, credentials, or PII.
- Screenshot paths are used for analysis guidance; no file access by this skill.
- Color values and font names are treated as configuration data.

---

## 15. Scalability Model

| Dimension | Constraint | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Throughput | CPU-bound decision tree | < 50ms; scales linearly |
| Concurrency | Stateless invocations | Unlimited parallel |
| Reference storage | 5 files (~8 KB total) | Static; no growth |
| Memory per invocation | < 1 MB | No accumulation |
| Network | Zero network calls | No external dependency |

---

## 16. Concurrency Model

Fully parallel. No shared state. No coordination required.

---

## 17. Resource Lifecycle Management

All resources scoped to invocation. No persistent handles.

---

## 18. Performance Constraints

| Operation | P50 Target | P99 Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Direction selection | < 5 ms | < 15 ms | 50 ms |
| Full design spec | < 15 ms | < 40 ms | 100 ms |
| Anti-slop check | < 3 ms | < 10 ms | 30 ms |
| Output size | ≤ 1,000 chars | ≤ 3,000 chars | 5,000 chars |

---

## 19. Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Aesthetic direction too extreme | Low | Client rejection | 5 directions cover broad spectrum |
| Anti-slop false positive | Medium | Blocks valid choices | 4 specific bans, not blanket rules |
| Typography pairing mismatch | Low | Readability issues | Display + body pairing is well-established |
| Color fails WCAG contrast | Medium | Accessibility violation | Downstream check by web-design-guidelines |
| Screenshot extraction inaccurate | Medium | Wrong implementation | 4-step verification process |

---

### Rule: motion-design

---
name: motion-design
description: Orchestrated entrances — CSS stagger, Framer Motion variants, Anime.js timeline, duration guide
---

# Motion Design

> One orchestrated animation > many scattered micro-interactions.

---

## Principle: Orchestrated Entrances

Don't scatter animations. Create one impactful page load sequence:

```css
/* Staggered entrance animation */
.hero-title {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.6s ease-out;
}

.hero-subtitle {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.6s ease-out 0.2s;
  animation-fill-mode: backwards;
}

.hero-cta {
  animation: fadeInUp 0.6s ease-out 0.4s;
  animation-fill-mode: backwards;
}

@keyframes fadeInUp {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

---

## Animation Timing

| Easing | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `ease-out` | Entrances (fast start, slow end) |
| `ease-in` | Exits (slow start, fast end) |
| `ease-in-out` | Continuous motion |
| `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` | Bouncy, playful |

---

## Duration Guidelines

| Element | Duration |
|---------|----------|
| Micro-interactions | 100-200ms |
| Component transitions | 200-400ms |
| Page transitions | 400-600ms |
| Hero animations | 600-1000ms |

---

## React Motion Library

```jsx
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

const fadeUp = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }
};

const staggerContainer = {
  hidden: {},
  visible: {
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.2
    }
  }
};

function Hero() {
  return (
    <motion.div
      variants={staggerContainer}
      initial="hidden"
      animate="visible"
    >
      <motion.h1 variants={fadeUp}>Title</motion.h1>
      <motion.p variants={fadeUp}>Subtitle</motion.p>
      <motion.button variants={fadeUp}>CTA</motion.button>
    </motion.div>
  );
}
```

---

## Anime.js for Complex Animations

```javascript
import anime from 'animejs';

// Timeline for orchestrated sequence
const tl = anime.timeline({
  easing: 'easeOutExpo',
  duration: 750
});

tl
  .add({
    targets: '.hero-title',
    opacity: [0, 1],
    translateY: [50, 0]
  })
  .add({
    targets: '.hero-subtitle',
    opacity: [0, 1],
    translateY: [30, 0]
  }, '-=500') // Overlap by 500ms
  .add({
    targets: '.hero-cta',
    opacity: [0, 1],
    scale: [0.9, 1]
  }, '-=400');
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|-------|
| Animate everything | Selective, purposeful motion |
| Random timing | Consistent timing system |
| Competing animations | Single focal point |
| Slow entrances (>1s) | Quick, impactful (<600ms) |
| Animation without purpose | Motion that guides attention |

---

# Motion Graphics Reference

> Advanced animation techniques for premium web experiences - Lottie, GSAP, SVG, 3D, Particles.
> **Learn the principles, create WOW effects.**

---

## 1. Lottie Animations

### What is Lottie?

```
JSON-based vector animations:
├── Exported from After Effects via Bodymovin
├── Lightweight (smaller than GIF/video)
├── Scalable (vector-based, no pixelation)
├── Interactive (control playback, segments)
└── Cross-platform (web, iOS, Android, React Native)
```

### When to Use Lottie

| Use Case | Why Lottie? |
|----------|-------------|
| **Loading animations** | Branded, smooth, lightweight |
| **Empty states** | Engaging illustrations |
| **Onboarding flows** | Complex multi-step animations |
| **Success/Error feedback** | Delightful micro-interactions |
| **Animated icons** | Consistent cross-platform |

### Principles

- Keep file size under 100KB for performance
- Use loop sparingly (avoid distraction)
- Provide static fallback for reduced-motion
- Lazy load animation files when possible

### Sources

- LottieFiles.com (free library)
- After Effects + Bodymovin (custom)
- Figma plugins (export from design)

---

## 2. GSAP (GreenSock)

### What Makes GSAP Different

```
Professional timeline-based animation:
├── Precise control over sequences
├── ScrollTrigger for scroll-driven animations
├── MorphSVG for shape transitions
├── Physics-based easing
└── Works with any DOM element
```

### Core Concepts

| Concept | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Tween** | Single A→B animation |
| **Timeline** | Sequenced/overlapping animations |
| **ScrollTrigger** | Scroll position controls playback |
| **Stagger** | Cascade effect across elements |

### When to Use GSAP

- ✅ Complex sequenced animations
- ✅ Scroll-triggered reveals
- ✅ Precise timing control needed
- ✅ SVG morphing effects
- ❌ Simple hover/focus effects (use CSS)
- ❌ Performance-critical mobile (heavier)

### Principles

- Use timeline for orchestration (not individual tweens)
- Stagger delay: 0.05-0.15s between items
- ScrollTrigger: start at 70-80% viewport entry
- Kill animations on unmount (prevent memory leaks)

---

## 3. SVG Animations

### Types of SVG Animation

| Type | Technique | Use Case |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Line Drawing** | stroke-dashoffset | Logo reveals, signatures |
| **Morph** | Path interpolation | Icon transitions |
| **Transform** | rotate, scale, translate | Interactive icons |
| **Color** | fill/stroke transition | State changes |

### Line Drawing Principles

```
How stroke-dashoffset drawing works:
├── Set dasharray to path length
├── Set dashoffset equal to dasharray (hidden)
├── Animate dashoffset to 0 (revealed)
└── Create "drawing" effect
```

### When to Use SVG Animations

- ✅ Logo reveals, brand moments
- ✅ Icon state transitions (hamburger ↔ X)
- ✅ Infographics, data visualization
- ✅ Interactive illustrations
- ❌ Photo-realistic content (use video)
- ❌ Very complex scenes (performance)

### Principles

- Get path length dynamically for accuracy
- Duration: 1-3s for full drawings
- Easing: ease-out for natural feel
- Simple fills complement, don't compete

---

## 4. 3D CSS Transforms

### Core Properties

```
CSS 3D Space:
├── perspective: depth of 3D field (500-1500px typical)
├── transform-style: preserve-3d (enable children 3D)
├── rotateX/Y/Z: rotation per axis
├── translateZ: move toward/away from viewer
└── backface-visibility: show/hide back side
```

### Common 3D Patterns

| Pattern | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| **Card flip** | Reveals, flashcards, product views |
| **Tilt on hover** | Interactive cards, 3D depth |
| **Parallax layers** | Hero sections, immersive scrolling |
| **3D carousel** | Image galleries, sliders |

### Principles

- Perspective: 800-1200px for subtle, 400-600px for dramatic
- Keep transforms simple (rotate + translate)
- Ensure backface-visibility: hidden for flips
- Test on Safari (different rendering)

---

## 5. Particle Effects

### Types of Particle Systems

| Type | Feel | Use Case |
|------|------|----------|
| **Geometric** | Tech, network | SaaS, tech sites |
| **Confetti** | Celebration | Success moments |
| **Snow/Rain** | Atmospheric | Seasonal, mood |
| **Dust/Bokeh** | Dreamy | Photography, luxury |
| **Fireflies** | Magical | Games, fantasy |

### Libraries

| Library | Best For |
|---------|----------|
| **tsParticles** | Configurable, lightweight |
| **particles.js** | Simple backgrounds |
| **Canvas API** | Custom, maximum control |
| **Three.js** | Complex 3D particles |

### Principles

- Default: 30-50 particles (not overwhelming)
- Movement: slow, organic (speed 0.5-2)
- Opacity: 0.3-0.6 (don't compete with content)
- Connections: subtle lines for "network" feel
- ⚠️ Disable or reduce on mobile

### When to Use

- ✅ Hero backgrounds (atmospheric)
- ✅ Success celebrations (confetti burst)
- ✅ Tech visualization (connected nodes)
- ❌ Content-heavy pages (distraction)
- ❌ Low-powered devices (battery drain)

---

## 6. Scroll-Driven Animations

### Native CSS (Modern)

```
CSS Scroll Timelines:
├── animation-timeline: scroll() - document scroll
├── animation-timeline: view() - element in viewport
├── animation-range: entry/exit thresholds
└── No JavaScript required
```

### Principles

| Trigger Point | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|
| **Entry 0%** | When element starts entering |
| **Entry 50%** | When half visible |
| **Cover 50%** | When centered in viewport |
| **Exit 100%** | When fully exited |

### Best Practices

- Reveal animations: start at ~25% entry
- Parallax: continuous scroll progress
- Sticky elements: use cover range
- Always test scroll performance

---

## 7. Performance Principles

### GPU vs CPU Animation

```
CHEAP (GPU-accelerated):
├── transform (translate, scale, rotate)
├── opacity
└── filter (use sparingly)

EXPENSIVE (triggers reflow):
├── width, height
├── top, left, right, bottom
├── padding, margin
└── complex box-shadow
```

### Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Animate only transform/opacity
- [ ] Use `will-change` before heavy animations (remove after)
- [ ] Test on low-end devices
- [ ] Implement `prefers-reduced-motion`
- [ ] Lazy load animation libraries
- [ ] Throttle scroll-based calculations

---

## 8. Motion Graphics Decision Tree

```
What animation do you need?
│
├── Complex branded animation?
│   └── Lottie (After Effects export)
│
├── Sequenced scroll-triggered?
│   └── GSAP + ScrollTrigger
│
├── Logo/icon animation?
│   └── SVG animation (stroke or morph)
│
├── Interactive 3D effect?
│   └── CSS 3D Transforms (simple) or Three.js (complex)
│
├── Atmospheric background?
│   └── tsParticles or Canvas
│
└── Simple entrance/hover?
    └── CSS @keyframes or Framer Motion
```

---

## 9. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Animate everything at once | Stagger and sequence |
| Use heavy libraries for simple effects | Start with CSS |
| Ignore reduced-motion | Always provide fallback |
| Block main thread | Optimize for 60fps |
| Same particles every project | Match brand/context |
| Complex effects on mobile | Feature detection |

---

## 10. Quick Reference

| Effect | Tool | Performance |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Loading spinner | CSS/Lottie | Light |
| Staggered reveal | GSAP/Framer | Medium |
| SVG path draw | CSS stroke | Light |
| 3D card flip | CSS transforms | Light |
| Particle background | tsParticles | Heavy |
| Scroll parallax | GSAP ScrollTrigger | Medium |
| Shape morphing | GSAP MorphSVG | Medium |

---

> **Remember**: Motion graphics should enhance, not distract. Every animation must serve a PURPOSE—feedback, guidance, delight, or storytelling.

### Rule: spatial-composition

---
name: spatial-composition
description: Layout innovation — asymmetric grids, overlapping elements, diagonal flow, negative space
---

# Spatial Composition

> Break the grid. Create unexpected layouts.

---

## Principle: Break Expectations

Don't default to centered, symmetrical layouts. Create visual tension:

- **Asymmetric arrangements**
- **Overlapping elements**
- **Diagonal flow**
- **Generous negative space OR controlled density**

---

## Grid Breaking Techniques

### Asymmetric Grid
```css
.layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr; /* Unequal columns */
  gap: 48px;
}

/* Or magazine-style */
.layout-magazine {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto auto;
}

.featured {
  grid-column: 2 / 3;
  grid-row: 1 / 3;
}
```

### Overlapping Elements
```css
.card-overlap {
  position: relative;
}

.card-image {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

.card-content {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2;
  margin-top: -60px;
  margin-left: 40px;
  background: white;
  padding: 32px;
}
```

### Diagonal Flow
```css
.diagonal-section {
  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 5%, 100% 100%, 0 95%);
  padding: 120px 0;
}

/* Or with transform */
.diagonal-bg {
  transform: skewY(-3deg);
}

.diagonal-content {
  transform: skewY(3deg); /* Counter-rotate content */
}
```

---

## Negative Space

### Generous Whitespace
```css
.hero {
  padding: 160px 0;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.section {
  padding: 120px 0;
}

.content {
  max-width: 720px; /* Narrow reading width */
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

### Controlled Density
```css
.dense-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
  gap: 8px; /* Tight gap */
}

.dense-card {
  padding: 16px;
  aspect-ratio: 1;
}
```

---

## Position Breaking

### Off-center Hero
```css
.hero {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1.5fr;
  gap: 80px;
  align-items: center;
}

.hero-content {
  padding-left: 10%; /* Offset from edge */
}

.hero-image {
  margin-right: -80px; /* Bleed off edge */
}
```

### Sticky Sidebar
```css
.layout-sticky {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 300px 1fr;
  gap: 48px;
}

.sidebar {
  position: sticky;
  top: 24px;
  height: fit-content;
}
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Generic | ✅ Distinctive |
|-----------|---------------|
| Everything centered | Intentional asymmetry |
| Equal padding everywhere | Varied spacing with purpose |
| Straight edges only | Occasional diagonals, curves |
| No overlap | Strategic layering |
| Predictable grid | Broken expectations |

## Distinctive Font Pairings

| Pairing | Display | Body | Mood |
|---------|---------|------|------|
| **Editorial** | Playfair Display | Source Sans Pro | Elegant, magazine |
| **Modern Tech** | Syne | IBM Plex Sans | Bold, technical |
| **Refined** | Fraunces | Work Sans | Warm, crafted |
| **Clean Cut** | DM Serif Display | DM Sans | Sharp, professional |
| **Brutalist** | Space Mono | Space Grotesk | Raw, technical |
| **Luxe** | Cormorant Garamond | Inter | Sophisticated |

---

## Typography Scale

```css
:root {
  /* Fluid typography with clamp */
  --text-xs: clamp(12px, 1vw, 14px);
  --text-sm: clamp(14px, 1.2vw, 16px);
  --text-base: clamp(16px, 1.5vw, 18px);
  --text-lg: clamp(18px, 2vw, 20px);
  --text-xl: clamp(24px, 3vw, 30px);
  --text-2xl: clamp(32px, 4vw, 40px);
  --text-3xl: clamp(40px, 5vw, 56px);
  --text-4xl: clamp(48px, 6vw, 72px);
  --text-hero: clamp(56px, 8vw, 120px);
}

/* Line heights */
--leading-tight: 0.95;
--leading-snug: 1.1;
--leading-normal: 1.5;
--leading-relaxed: 1.65;
```

---

## Display vs Body

**Display fonts** (headings): Character, personality, memorable
- Use sparingly: hero, h1, h2
- Large sizes: 32px+
- Tight line-height: 0.95-1.1
- Negative letter-spacing: -0.02em to -0.04em

**Body fonts** (text): Readable, neutral, comfortable
- Use everywhere else
- 16-20px base size
- Relaxed line-height: 1.5-1.65
- Normal letter-spacing

---

## Anti-Pattern: Generic Typography

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|-------|
| Inter everywhere | Distinctive display + neutral body |
| System fonts | Custom Google Fonts |
| Same size for all headings | Clear hierarchy with scale |
| Default line-height | Tight for display, relaxed for body |
| No letter-spacing | Adjust per context |

---

## Loading Fonts

```html
<!-- Preconnect for performance -->
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">

# Typography System Reference

> Typography principles and decision-making - learn to think, not memorize.
> **No fixed font names or sizes - understand the system.**

---

## 1. Modular Scale Principles

### What is a Modular Scale?

```
A mathematical relationship between font sizes:
├── Pick a BASE size (usually body text)
├── Pick a RATIO (multiplier)
└── Generate all sizes using: base × ratio^n
```

### Common Ratios and When to Use

| Ratio | Value | Feeling | Best For |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|
| Minor Second | 1.067 | Very subtle | Dense UI, small screens |
| Major Second | 1.125 | Subtle | Compact interfaces |
| Minor Third | 1.2 | Comfortable | Mobile apps, cards |
| Major Third | 1.25 | Balanced | General web (most common) |
| Perfect Fourth | 1.333 | Noticeable | Editorial, blogs |
| Perfect Fifth | 1.5 | Dramatic | Headlines, marketing |
| Golden Ratio | 1.618 | Maximum impact | Hero sections, display |

### Generate Your Scale

```
Given: base = YOUR_BASE_SIZE, ratio = YOUR_RATIO

Scale:
├── xs:  base ÷ ratio²
├── sm:  base ÷ ratio
├── base: YOUR_BASE_SIZE
├── lg:  base × ratio
├── xl:  base × ratio²
├── 2xl: base × ratio³
├── 3xl: base × ratio⁴
└── ... continue as needed
```

### Choosing Base Size

| Context | Base Size Range | Why |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Mobile-first | 16-18px | Readability on small screens |
| Desktop app | 14-16px | Information density |
| Editorial | 18-21px | Long-form reading comfort |
| Accessibility focus | 18px+ | Easier to read |

---

## 2. Font Pairing Principles

### What Makes Fonts Work Together

```
Contrast + Harmony:
├── Different ENOUGH to create hierarchy
├── Similar ENOUGH to feel cohesive
└── Usually: serif + sans, or display + neutral
```

### Pairing Strategies

| Strategy | How | Result |
|----------|-----|--------|
| **Contrast** | Serif heading + Sans body | Classic, editorial feel |
| **Same Family** | One variable font, different weights | Cohesive, modern |
| **Same Designer** | Fonts by same foundry | Often harmonious proportions |
| **Era Match** | Fonts from same time period | Historical consistency |

### What to Look For

```
When pairing, compare:
├── x-height (height of lowercase letters)
├── Letter width (narrow vs wide)
├── Stroke contrast (thin/thick variation)
└── Overall mood (formal vs casual)
```

### Safe Pairing Patterns

| Heading Style | Body Style | Mood |
|---------------|------------|------|
| Geometric sans | Humanist sans | Modern, friendly |
| Display serif | Clean sans | Editorial, sophisticated |
| Neutral sans | Same sans | Minimal, tech |
| Bold geometric | Light geometric | Contemporary |

### Avoid

- ❌ Two decorative fonts together
- ❌ Similar fonts that conflict
- ❌ More than 2-3 font families
- ❌ Fonts with very different x-heights

---

## 3. Line Height Principles

### The Relationship

```
Line height depends on:
├── Font size (larger text = less line height needed)
├── Line length (longer lines = more line height)
├── Font design (some fonts need more space)
└── Content type (headings vs body)
```

### Guidelines by Context

| Content Type | Line Height Range | Why |
|--------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Headings** | 1.1 - 1.3 | Short lines, want compact |
| **Body text** | 1.4 - 1.6 | Comfortable reading |
| **Long-form** | 1.6 - 1.8 | Maximum readability |
| **UI elements** | 1.2 - 1.4 | Space efficiency |

### Adjustment Factors

- **Longer line length** → Increase line height
- **Larger font size** → Decrease line height ratio
- **All caps** → May need more line height
- **Tight tracking** → May need more line height

---

## 4. Line Length Principles

### Optimal Reading Width

```
The sweet spot: 45-75 characters per line
├── < 45: Too choppy, breaks flow
├── 45-75: Comfortable reading
├── > 75: Eye tracking strain
```

### How to Measure

```css
/* Character-based (recommended) */
max-width: 65ch; /* ch = width of "0" character */

/* This adapts to font size automatically */
```

### Context Adjustments

| Context | Character Range |
|---------|-----------------|
| Desktop article | 60-75 characters |
| Mobile | 35-50 characters |
| Sidebar text | 30-45 characters |
| Wide monitors | Still cap at ~75ch |

---

## 5. Responsive Typography Principles

### The Problem

```
Fixed sizes don't scale well:
├── Desktop size too big on mobile
├── Mobile size too small on desktop
└── Breakpoint jumps feel jarring
```

### Fluid Typography (clamp)

```css
/* Syntax: clamp(MIN, PREFERRED, MAX) */
font-size: clamp(
  MINIMUM_SIZE,
  FLUID_CALCULATION,
  MAXIMUM_SIZE
);

/* FLUID_CALCULATION typically: 
   base + viewport-relative-unit */
```

### Scaling Strategy

| Element | Scaling Behavior |
|---------|-----------------|
| Body text | Slight scaling (1rem → 1.125rem) |
| Subheadings | Moderate scaling |
| Headings | More dramatic scaling |
| Display text | Most dramatic scaling |

---

## 6. Weight and Emphasis Principles

### Semantic Weight Usage

| Weight Range | Name | Use For |
|--------------|------|---------|
| 300-400 | Light/Normal | Body text, paragraphs |
| 500 | Medium | Subtle emphasis |
| 600 | Semibold | Subheadings, labels |
| 700 | Bold | Headings, strong emphasis |
| 800-900 | Heavy/Black | Display, hero text |

### Creating Contrast

```
Good contrast = skip at least 2 weight levels
├── 400 body + 700 heading = good
├── 400 body + 500 emphasis = subtle
├── 600 heading + 700 subheading = too similar
```

### Avoid

- ❌ Too many weights (max 3-4 per page)
- ❌ Adjacent weights for hierarchy (400/500)
- ❌ Heavy weights for long text

---

## 7. Letter Spacing (Tracking)

### Principles

```
Large text (headings): tighter tracking
├── Letters are big, gaps feel larger
└── Slight negative tracking looks better

Small text (body): normal or slightly wider
├── Improves readability at small sizes
└── Never negative for body text

ALL CAPS: always wider tracking
├── Uppercase lacks ascenders/descenders
└── Needs more space to feel right
```

### Adjustment Guidelines

| Context | Tracking Adjustment |
|---------|---------------------|
| Display/Hero | -2% to -4% |
| Headings | -1% to -2% |
| Body text | 0% (normal) |
| Small text | +1% to +2% |
| ALL CAPS | +5% to +10% |

---

## 8. Hierarchy Principles

### Visual Hierarchy Through Type

```
Ways to create hierarchy:
├── SIZE (most obvious)
├── WEIGHT (bold stands out)
├── COLOR (contrast levels)
├── SPACING (margins separate sections)
└── POSITION (top = important)
```

### Typical Hierarchy

| Level | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| Primary (H1) | Largest, boldest, most distinct |
| Secondary (H2) | Noticeably smaller but still bold |
| Tertiary (H3) | Medium size, may use weight only |
| Body | Standard size and weight |
| Caption/Meta | Smaller, often lighter color |

### Testing Hierarchy

Ask: "Can I tell what's most important at a glance?"

If squinting at the page, the hierarchy should still be clear.

---

## 9. Readability Psychology

### F-Pattern Reading

```
Users scan in F-pattern:
├── Across the top (first line)
├── Down the left side
├── Across again (subheading)
└── Continue down left
```

**Implication**: Key info on left and in headings

### Chunking for Comprehension

- Short paragraphs (3-4 lines max)
- Clear subheadings
- Bullet points for lists
- White space between sections

### Cognitive Ease

- Familiar fonts = easier reading
- High contrast = less strain
- Consistent patterns = predictable

---

## 10. Typography Selection Checklist

Before finalizing typography:

- [ ] **Asked user for font preferences?**
- [ ] **Considered brand/context?**
- [ ] **Selected appropriate scale ratio?**
- [ ] **Limited to 2-3 font families?**
- [ ] **Tested readability at all sizes?**
- [ ] **Checked line length (45-75ch)?**
- [ ] **Verified contrast for accessibility?**
- [ ] **Different from your last project?**

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Same fonts every project
- ❌ Too many font families
- ❌ Ignoring readability for style
- ❌ Fixed sizes without responsiveness
- ❌ Decorative fonts for body text

---

> **Remember**: Typography is about communication clarity. Choose based on content needs and audience, not personal preference.

---

# UX Psychology Reference

> Deep dive into UX laws, emotional design, trust building, and behavioral psychology.

---

## 1. Core UX Laws

### Hick's Law

**Principle:** The time to make a decision increases logarithmically with the number of choices.

```
Decision Time = a + b × log₂(n + 1)
Where n = number of choices
```

**Application:**
- Navigation: Max 5-7 top-level items
- Forms: Break into steps (progressive disclosure)
- Options: Default selections when possible
- Filters: Prioritize most-used, hide advanced

**Example:**
```
❌ Bad: 15 menu items in one nav
✅ Good: 5 main categories + "More" 

❌ Bad: 20 form fields at once
✅ Good: 3-step wizard with 5-7 fields each
```

---

### Fitts' Law

**Principle:** Time to reach a target = function of distance and size.

```
MT = a + b × log₂(1 + D/W)
Where D = distance, W = width
```

**Application:**
- CTAs: Make primary buttons larger (min 44px height)
- Touch targets: 44×44px minimum on mobile
- Placement: Important actions near natural cursor position
- Corners: "Magic corners" (infinite edge = easy to hit)

**Button Sizing:**
```css
/* Size by importance */
.btn-primary { height: 48px; padding: 0 24px; }
.btn-secondary { height: 40px; padding: 0 16px; }
.btn-tertiary { height: 36px; padding: 0 12px; }

/* Mobile touch targets */
@media (hover: none) {
  .btn { min-height: 44px; min-width: 44px; }
}
```

---

### Miller's Law

**Principle:** Average person can hold 7±2 chunks in working memory.

**Application:**
- Lists: Group into chunks of 5-7 items
- Navigation: Max 7 menu items
- Content: Break long content with headings
- Phone numbers: 555-123-4567 (chunked)

**Chunking Example:**
```
❌ 5551234567
✅ 555-123-4567

❌ Long paragraph of text without breaks
✅ Short paragraphs
   With bullet points
   And subheadings
```

---

### Von Restorff Effect (Isolation Effect)

**Principle:** An item that stands out is more likely to be remembered.

**Application:**
- CTA buttons: Distinct color from other elements
- Pricing: Highlight recommended plan
- Important info: Visual differentiation
- New features: Badge or callout

**Example:**
```css
/* All buttons gray, primary stands out */
.btn { background: #E5E7EB; }
.btn-primary { background: #3B82F6; }

/* Recommended plan highlighted */
.pricing-card { border: 1px solid #E5E7EB; }
.pricing-card.popular { 
  border: 2px solid #3B82F6;
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-lg);
}
```

---

### Serial Position Effect

**Principle:** Items at the beginning (primacy) and end (recency) of a list are remembered best.

**Application:**
- Navigation: Most important items first and last
- Lists: Key info at top and bottom
- Forms: Most critical fields at start
- CTAs: Repeat at top and bottom of long pages

**Example:**
```
Navigation: Home | [key items] | Contact

Long landing page:
- CTA at hero (top)
- Content sections
- CTA repeated at bottom
```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Designing for Each Level

**Visceral:**
```css
/* Beautiful first impression */
.hero {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #0ea5e9 0%, #14b8a6 100%);
  color: white;
}

/* Pleasing microinteractions */
.button:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-lg);
}
```

**Behavioral:**
```javascript
// Instant feedback
button.onclick = () => {
  button.disabled = true;
  button.textContent = 'Saving...';
  
  save().then(() => {
    showSuccess('Saved!');  // Immediate confirmation
  });
};
```

**Reflective:**
```html
<!-- Brand story and values -->
<section class="about">
  <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
  <p>We believe technology should empower, not complicate...</p>
</section>

<!-- Social proof connecting to identity -->
<blockquote>
  "This tool helped me become the designer I wanted to be."
</blockquote>
```

---

## 3. Trust Building System

### Trust Signal Categories

| Category | Elements | Implementation |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Security** | SSL, badges, encryption | Visible padlock, security logos on forms |
| **Social Proof** | Reviews, testimonials, logos | Star ratings, customer photos, brand logos |
| **Transparency** | Policies, pricing, contact | Clear links, no hidden fees, real address |
| **Professional** | Design quality, consistency | No broken elements, consistent branding |
| **Authority** | Certifications, awards, media | "As seen in...", industry certifications |

### Trust Signal Placement

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HEADER: Trust banner ("Free shipping | 30-day    │
│          returns | Secure checkout")               │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  HERO: Social proof ("Trusted by 10,000+")        │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  PRODUCT: Reviews visible, security badges         │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  CHECKOUT: Payment icons, SSL badge, guarantee     │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  FOOTER: Contact info, policies, certifications    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Trust-Building CSS Patterns

```css
/* Trust badge styling */
.trust-badge {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 8px;
  padding: 12px 16px;
  background: #F0FDF4;  /* Light green = security */
  border-radius: 2px; /* Sharp for trust = precision feel */
  font-size: 14px;
  color: #166534;
}

/* Secure form indicator */
.secure-form::before {
  content: '🔒 Secure form';
  display: block;
  font-size: 12px;
  color: #166534;
  margin-bottom: 8px;
}

/* Testimonial card */
.testimonial {
  display: flex;
  gap: 16px;
  padding: 24px;
  background: white;
  border-radius: 16px; /* Friendly = larger radius */
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-sm);
}

.testimonial-avatar {
  width: 48px;
  height: 48px;
  border-radius: 50%;  /* Real photos > initials */
}
```

---

## 4. Cognitive Load Management

### Three Types of Cognitive Load

| Type | Definition | Designer's Role |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| **Intrinsic** | Inherent complexity of task | Break into smaller steps |
| **Extraneous** | Load from poor design | Eliminate this! |
| **Germane** | Effort for learning | Support and encourage |

### Reduction Strategies

**1. Simplify (Reduce Extraneous)**
```css
/* Visual noise → Clean */
.card-busy {
  border: 2px solid red;
  background: linear-gradient(...);
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px ...;
  /* Too much! */
}

.card-clean {
  background: white;
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 10px 30px -10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  /* Calm, focused */
}
```

**2. Chunk Information**
```html
<!-- Overwhelming -->
<form>
  <!-- 15 fields at once -->
</form>

<!-- Chunked -->
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Step 1: Personal Info</legend>
    <!-- 3-4 fields -->
  </fieldset>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Step 2: Shipping</legend>
    <!-- 3-4 fields -->
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

**3. Progressive Disclosure**
```html
<!-- Hide complexity until needed -->
<div class="filters">
  <div class="filters-basic">
    <!-- Common filters visible -->
  </div>
  <button onclick="toggleAdvanced()">
    Advanced Options ▼
  </button>
  <div class="filters-advanced" hidden>
    <!-- Complex filters hidden -->
  </div>
</div>
```

**4. Use Familiar Patterns**
```
✅ Standard navigation placement
✅ Expected icon meanings (🔍 = search)
✅ Conventional form layouts
✅ Common gesture patterns (swipe, pinch)
```

**5. Offload Information**
```html
<!-- Don't make users remember -->
<label>
  Card Number
  <input type="text" inputmode="numeric" 
         autocomplete="cc-number" 
         placeholder="1234 5678 9012 3456">
</label>

<!-- Show what they entered -->
<div class="order-summary">
  <p>Shipping to: <strong>John Doe, 123 Main St...</strong></p>
  <a href="#">Edit</a>
</div>
```

---

## 5. Persuasive Design (Ethical)

### Ethical Persuasion Techniques

| Technique | Ethical Use | Dark Pattern (Avoid) |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Scarcity** | Real stock levels | Fake countdown timers |

# Visual Effects Reference

> Modern CSS effect principles and techniques - learn the concepts, create variations.
> **No fixed values to copy - understand the patterns.**

---

## 1. Glassmorphism Principles

### What Makes Glassmorphism Work

```
Key Properties:
├── Semi-transparent background (not solid)
├── Backdrop blur (frosted glass effect)
├── Subtle border (for definition)
└── Often: light shadow for depth
```

### The Pattern (Customize Values)

```css
.glass {
  /* Transparency: adjust opacity based on content readability */
  background: rgba(R, G, B, OPACITY);
  /* OPACITY: 0.1-0.3 for dark bg, 0.5-0.8 for light bg */
  
  /* Blur: higher = more frosted */
  backdrop-filter: blur(AMOUNT);
  /* AMOUNT: 8-12px subtle, 16-24px strong */
  
  /* Border: defines edges */
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, OPACITY);
  /* OPACITY: 0.1-0.3 typically */
  
  /* Radius: match your design system */
  border-radius: YOUR_RADIUS;
}
```

### When to Use Glassmorphism
- ✅ Over colorful/image backgrounds
- ✅ Modals, overlays, cards
- ✅ Navigation bars with scrolling content behind
- ❌ Text-heavy content (readability issues)
- ❌ Simple solid backgrounds (pointless)

### When NOT to Use
- Low contrast situations
- Accessibility-critical content
- Performance-constrained devices

---

## 2. Neomorphism Principles

### What Makes Neomorphism Work

```
Key Concept: Soft, extruded elements using DUAL shadows
├── Light shadow (from light source direction)
├── Dark shadow (opposite direction)
└── Background matches surrounding (same color)
```

### The Pattern

```css
.neo-raised {
  /* Background MUST match parent */
  background: SAME_AS_PARENT;
  
  /* Two shadows: light direction + dark direction */
  box-shadow: 
    OFFSET OFFSET BLUR rgba(light-color),
    -OFFSET -OFFSET BLUR rgba(dark-color);
  
  /* OFFSET: typically 6-12px */
  /* BLUR: typically 12-20px */
}

.neo-pressed {
  /* Inset creates "pushed in" effect */
  box-shadow: 
    inset OFFSET OFFSET BLUR rgba(dark-color),
    inset -OFFSET -OFFSET BLUR rgba(light-color);
}
```

### Accessibility Warning
⚠️ **Low contrast** - use sparingly, ensure clear boundaries

### When to Use
- Decorative elements
- Subtle interactive states
- Minimalist UI with flat colors

---

## 3. Shadow Hierarchy Principles

### Concept: Shadows Indicate Elevation

```
Higher elevation = larger shadow
├── Level 0: No shadow (flat on surface)
├── Level 1: Subtle shadow (slightly raised)
├── Level 2: Medium shadow (cards, buttons)
├── Level 3: Large shadow (modals, dropdowns)
└── Level 4: Deep shadow (floating elements)
```

### Shadow Properties to Adjust

```css
box-shadow: OFFSET-X OFFSET-Y BLUR SPREAD COLOR;

/* Offset: direction of shadow */
/* Blur: softness (larger = softer) */
/* Spread: size expansion */
/* Color: typically black with low opacity */
```

### Principles for Natural Shadows

1. **Y-offset larger than X** (light comes from above)
2. **Low opacity** (5-15% for subtle, 15-25% for pronounced)
3. **Multiple layers** for realism (ambient + direct)
4. **Blur scales with offset** (larger offset = larger blur)

### Dark Mode Shadows
- Shadows less visible on dark backgrounds
- May need to increase opacity
- Or use glow/highlight instead

---

## 4. Gradient Principles

### Types and When to Use

| Type | Pattern | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Linear** | Color A → Color B along line | Backgrounds, buttons, headers |
| **Radial** | Center → outward | Spotlights, focal points |
| **Conic** | Around center | Pie charts, creative effects |

### Creating Harmonious Gradients

```
Good Gradient Rules:
├── Use ADJACENT colors on wheel (analogous)
├── Or same hue with different lightness
├── Avoid complementary (can look harsh)
└── Add middle stops for smoother transitions
```

### Gradient Syntax Pattern

```css
.gradient {
  background: linear-gradient(
    DIRECTION,           /* angle or to-keyword */
    COLOR-STOP-1,        /* color + optional position */
    COLOR-STOP-2,
    /* ... more stops */
  );
}

/* DIRECTION examples: */
/* 90deg, 135deg, to right, to bottom right */
```

### Mesh Gradients

```
Multiple radial gradients overlapped:
├── Each at different position
├── Each with transparent falloff
├── **Mandatory for "Wow" factor in Hero sections**
└── Creates organic, colorful effect (Search: "Aurora Gradient CSS")
```

---

## 5. Border Effects Principles

### Gradient Borders

```
Technique: Pseudo-element with gradient background
├── Element has padding = border width
├── Pseudo-element fills with gradient
└── Mask or clip creates border effect
```

### Animated Borders

```
Technique: Rotating gradient or conic sweep
├── Pseudo-element larger than content
├── Animation rotates the gradient
└── Overflow hidden clips to shape
```

### Glow Borders

```css
/* Multiple box-shadows create glow */
box-shadow:
  0 0 SMALL-BLUR COLOR,
  0 0 MEDIUM-BLUR COLOR,
  0 0 LARGE-BLUR COLOR;

/* Each layer adds to the glow */
```

---

## 6. Glow Effects Principles

### Text Glow

```css
text-shadow: 
  0 0 BLUR-1 COLOR,
  0 0 BLUR-2 COLOR,
  0 0 BLUR-3 COLOR;

/* Multiple layers = stronger glow */
/* Larger blur = softer spread */
```

### Element Glow

```css
box-shadow:
  0 0 BLUR-1 COLOR,
  0 0 BLUR-2 COLOR;

/* Use color matching element for realistic glow */
/* Lower opacity for subtle, higher for neon */
```

### Pulsing Glow Animation

```css
@keyframes glow-pulse {
  0%, 100% { box-shadow: 0 0 SMALL-BLUR COLOR; }
  50% { box-shadow: 0 0 LARGE-BLUR COLOR; }
}

/* Easing and duration affect feel */
```

---

## 7. Overlay Techniques

### Gradient Overlay on Images

```
Purpose: Improve text readability over images
Pattern: Gradient from transparent to opaque
Position: Where text will appear
```

```css
.overlay::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(
    DIRECTION,
    transparent PERCENTAGE,
    rgba(0,0,0,OPACITY) 100%
  );
}
```

### Colored Overlay

```css
/* Blend mode or layered gradient */
background: 
  linear-gradient(YOUR-COLOR-WITH-OPACITY),
  url('image.jpg');
```

---

## 8. Modern CSS Techniques

### Container Queries (Concept)

```
Instead of viewport breakpoints:
├── Component responds to ITS container
├── Truly modular, reusable components
└── Syntax: @container (condition) { }
```

### :has() Selector (Concept)

```
Parent styling based on children:
├── "Parent that has X child"
├── Enables previously impossible patterns
└── Progressive enhancement approach
```

### Scroll-Driven Animations (Concept)

```
Animation progress tied to scroll:
├── Entry/exit animations on scroll
├── Parallax effects
├── Progress indicators
└── View-based or scroll-based timeline
```

---

## 9. Performance Principles

### GPU-Accelerated Properties

```
CHEAP to animate (GPU):
├── transform (translate, scale, rotate)
└── opacity

EXPENSIVE to animate (CPU):
├── width, height
├── top, left, right, bottom
├── margin, padding
└── box-shadow (recalculates)
```

### will-change Usage

```css
/* Use sparingly, only for heavy animations */
.heavy-animation {
  will-change: transform;
}

/* Remove after animation if possible */
```

### Reduced Motion

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Disable or minimize animations */
  /* Respect user preference */
}
```

## 10. Effect Selection Checklist

Before applying any effect:

- [ ] **Does it serve a purpose?** (not just decoration)
- [ ] **Is it appropriate for the context?** (brand, audience)
- [ ] **Have you varied from previous projects?** (avoid repetition)
- [ ] **Is it accessible?** (contrast, motion sensitivity)
- [ ] **Is it performant?** (especially on mobile)
- [ ] **Did you ask user preference?** (if style open-ended)

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Glassmorphism on every element (kitsch)
- ❌ Dark + neon as default (lazy AI look)
- ❌ **Static/Flat designs with no depth (FAILED)**
- ❌ Effects that hurt readability
- ❌ Animations without purpose

---

> **Remember**: Effects enhance meaning. Choose based on purpose and context, not because it "looks cool."
