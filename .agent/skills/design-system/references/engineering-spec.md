# Frontend Design — Engineering Specification

> Production-grade specification for distinctive frontend interface design decisions at FAANG scale.

---

## 1. Overview

Frontend Design provides structured decision frameworks for creating distinctive, production-grade web interfaces: aesthetic direction selection (5 styles), anti-AI-slop enforcement, design extraction from screenshots, typography pairing, color system commitment, and motion orchestration. The skill operates as an expert knowledge base with 5 reference files — it produces design direction decisions, aesthetic specifications, and implementation guidance. It does not write CSS, create components, or render UI.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Frontend design at scale faces four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Generic AI-generated UIs | 75% of AI-built interfaces use Inter + purple gradient + bento grid | Indistinguishable products |
| Timid color choices | 60% of projects use safe, muted palettes | No visual identity |
| Scattered animations | 45% of motion has no choreographic purpose | Visual noise, performance cost |
| Layout conformity | 70% of layouts follow identical card-grid patterns | No design differentiation |

Frontend Design eliminates these with bold aesthetic direction commitment, anti-AI-slop rules, and intentional design decisions.

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | Distinctive aesthetics | 1 of 5 committed directions; no "safe middle" |
| G2 | Anti-AI-slop | No generic fonts (Inter/Roboto alone), no pure RGB, no basic shadows |
| G3 | Bold typography | Display font + body font pairing; heading ≥ 48px |
| G4 | Committed color | Dominant primary + sharp accent; no more than 3 brand colors |
| G5 | Orchestrated motion | Single entrance sequence with staggered timing |
| G6 | Faithful reproduction | Screenshot → implementation match ≥ 95% accuracy |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | CSS/Tailwind code generation | Owned by `tailwind-kit` / caller |
| NG2 | Design token systems | Owned by `design-system` skill |
| NG3 | AI-powered style search | Owned by `studio` skill |
| NG4 | Asset/image generation | Owned by `ai-artist` skill |
| NG5 | Component architecture | Framework-specific concern |
| NG6 | WCAG accessibility | Owned by `web-design-guidelines` skill |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Aesthetic direction selection (5 styles) | Decision framework | CSS implementation |
| Anti-AI-slop enforcement (4 banned patterns) | Ban list and alternatives | Automated linting |
| Design extraction from screenshots | Extraction process (4 steps) | Screenshot capture |
| Typography pairing guidance | Font pair selection, sizing rules | Font loading |
| Color system commitment | Palette strategy (dominant + accent) | CSS custom properties |
| Motion orchestration | Choreography patterns | Animation library code |

**Side-effect boundary:** Frontend Design produces design decisions, aesthetic guidelines, and implementation specifications. It does not create files, write CSS, or render components.

```

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Same `brand_tone` = same aesthetic direction.
- Aesthetic selection is deterministic: tone → direction mapping is fixed.
- Anti-slop check uses fixed 4-ban list (generic fonts, pure RGB, basic shadows, scattered micro-interactions).
- Typography always pairs display + body font; heading minimum 48px.
- Color system always limits to 3 brand colors (dominant + accent + neutral).
- Motion always uses one orchestrated entrance pattern.

#### What Agents May Assume

- Aesthetic direction is committed (no "safe middle" options).
- Typography pairing is distinctive (not Inter/Roboto default).
- Color palette includes dominant, accent, and neutral.
- Anti-slop check covers all 4 banned AI patterns.

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- The skill generates CSS, HTML, or component code.
- Font files are available or loaded.
- Color values pass WCAG contrast requirements (→ web-design-guidelines).
- The skill creates design system tokens (→ design-system).

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| Aesthetic direction | None; decision output |
| Screenshot extract | None; analysis output |
| Typography guide | None; recommendation |
| Color system | None; palette specification |
| Motion guide | None; choreography recommendation |
| Anti-slop check | None; violation list |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Workflow 1: From Screenshots

```
1. Receive screenshot URL/path
2. Invoke screenshot-extract to analyze design
3. Document extracted specs (caller's responsibility)
4. Implement matching design (caller's responsibility)
5. Verify side-by-side (caller's responsibility)
```

#### Workflow 2: From Scratch

```
1. Define project type and brand tone
2. Invoke aesthetic-direction for committed style
3. Invoke typography-guide for font pairing
4. Invoke color-system for palette
5. Invoke motion-guide for choreography
6. Invoke anti-slop-check to validate decisions
7. Implement design (caller's responsibility)
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Each invocation produces a complete, self-contained recommendation.
- Anti-slop check can be invoked at any point for validation.

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Invalid request type | Return error to caller | Use supported type |
| Missing brand tone | Return error to caller | Supply brand tone |
| Anti-slop violation | Return violations status | Revise design choice |
| Screenshot not found | Return error to caller | Supply valid screenshot |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Zero internal retries. Deterministic output.

#### Isolation Model

- Each invocation is stateless and independent.

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Aesthetic direction | Yes | Same tone = same direction |
| Screenshot extract | Yes | Same screenshot = same analysis |
| Typography guide | Yes | Same context = same pairing |
| Color system | Yes | Same context = same palette |
| Motion guide | Yes | Same context = same choreography |
| Anti-slop check | Yes | Same input = same violations |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 3-Phase Lifecycle

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Parse** | Validate request type, brand tone, project type | Validated input or error |
| **Evaluate** | Traverse aesthetic decision tree; check anti-slop bans | Design recommendation |
| **Emit** | Return structured output with reference file link | Complete output schema |

All phases synchronous. No async pipeline.

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fixed aesthetic directions | 5 styles; no hybrid or "safe" options |
| Fixed anti-slop bans | 4 bans: generic fonts, pure RGB, basic shadows, scattered motion |
| Fixed typography minimum | Heading ≥ 48px; max 2 font families |
| Fixed color limit | Max 3 brand colors (dominant + accent + neutral) |
| Fixed motion rule | One orchestrated entrance; no scattered micro-interactions |
| Bold commitment | Every decision demands a committed direction |
| No external calls | All decisions based on embedded rules + reference files |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

Stateless. Fully idempotent. No persistent state.

Each invocation produces an identical output for identical inputs. No design history, no accumulated preferences.

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Unknown request type | Return `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Use supported type |
| Missing brand tone | Return `ERR_MISSING_BRAND_TONE` | Supply brand tone |
| Missing project type | Return `ERR_MISSING_PROJECT_TYPE` | Supply project type |
| Screenshot not found | Return `ERR_SCREENSHOT_NOT_FOUND` | Supply valid path |
| Anti-slop violation | Return `WARN_AI_SLOP` with violations | Revise design |
| Reference file missing | Return `ERR_REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` | Verify installation |

**Invariant:** Every failure returns a structured error. No silent fallback to "safe" defaults.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Validation | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_MISSING_BRAND_TONE` | Validation | Yes | Brand tone not provided |
| `ERR_MISSING_PROJECT_TYPE` | Validation | Yes | Project type not provided |
| `ERR_SCREENSHOT_NOT_FOUND` | Validation | Yes | Screenshot path invalid |
| `ERR_REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` | Infrastructure | No | Reference file missing |
| `WARN_AI_SLOP` | Design | Yes | Generic AI pattern detected |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Decision timeout | N/A | N/A | Synchronous; < 50ms |
| Internal retries | Zero | Zero | Deterministic output |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema

### Log Entry Format

```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "skill_name": "frontend-design",
  "contract_version": "2.0.0",
  "execution_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "request_type": "string",
  "brand_tone": "string|null",
  "aesthetic_direction": "string|null",
  "anti_slop_violations": "number",
  "status": "success|violations|error",
  "error_code": "string|null",
  "duration_ms": "number"
}
```

### Required Log Points

| Event | Log Level | Fields |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Direction selected | INFO | aesthetic_direction, brand_tone |
| Anti-slop violation | WARN | pattern, alternative |
| Decision failed | ERROR | error_code, message |

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Unit |
|--------|------|------|
| `frontenddesign.decision.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `frontenddesign.direction.selected` | Counter | per direction |
| `frontenddesign.slop_violation.count` | Counter | per pattern |
| `frontenddesign.request_type.distribution` | Counter | per type |

---

## 14. Security & Trust Model

### Data Handling

- Frontend Design does not access user data, credentials, or PII.
- Screenshot paths are used for analysis guidance; no file access by this skill.
- Color values and font names are treated as configuration data.

---

## 15. Scalability Model

| Dimension | Constraint | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Throughput | CPU-bound decision tree | < 50ms; scales linearly |
| Concurrency | Stateless invocations | Unlimited parallel |
| Reference storage | 5 files (~8 KB total) | Static; no growth |
| Memory per invocation | < 1 MB | No accumulation |
| Network | Zero network calls | No external dependency |

---

## 16. Concurrency Model

Fully parallel. No shared state. No coordination required.

---

## 17. Resource Lifecycle Management

All resources scoped to invocation. No persistent handles.

---

## 18. Performance Constraints

| Operation | P50 Target | P99 Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Direction selection | < 5 ms | < 15 ms | 50 ms |
| Full design spec | < 15 ms | < 40 ms | 100 ms |
| Anti-slop check | < 3 ms | < 10 ms | 30 ms |
| Output size | ≤ 1,000 chars | ≤ 3,000 chars | 5,000 chars |

---

## 19. Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Aesthetic direction too extreme | Low | Client rejection | 5 directions cover broad spectrum |
| Anti-slop false positive | Medium | Blocks valid choices | 4 specific bans, not blanket rules |
| Typography pairing mismatch | Low | Readability issues | Display + body pairing is well-established |
| Color fails WCAG contrast | Medium | Accessibility violation | Downstream check by web-design-guidelines |
| Screenshot extraction inaccurate | Medium | Wrong implementation | 4-step verification process |
