# Animation Guide: Duration Principles through 5. Page Transitions Principles

## Preconditions

Capture the baseline, target environment, acceptance criteria, and rollback point.

## Procedure

> Animation principles and timing psychology - learn to decide, not copy.
> **No fixed durations to memorize - understand what affects timing.**

---

## 1. Duration Principles

### What Affects Timing

```
Factors that determine animation speed:
├── DISTANCE: Further travel = longer duration
├── SIZE: Larger elements = slower animations
├── COMPLEXITY: Complex = slower to process
├── IMPORTANCE: Critical actions = clear feedback
└── CONTEXT: Urgent = fast, luxurious = slow
```

### Duration Ranges by Purpose

| Purpose | Range | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Instant feedback | 50-100ms | Below perception threshold |
| Micro-interactions | 100-200ms | Quick but noticeable |
| Standard transitions | 200-300ms | Comfortable pace |
| Complex animations | 300-500ms | Time to follow |
| Page transitions | 400-600ms | Smooth handoff |
| **Wow/Premium Effects** | 800ms+ | Dramatic, organic spring-based, layered |

### Choosing Duration

Ask yourself:
1. How far is the element moving?
2. How important is it to notice this change?
3. Is the user waiting, or is this background?

## 2. Easing Principles

### What Easing Does

```
Easing = how speed changes over time
├── Linear: constant speed (mechanical, robotic)
├── Ease-out: fast start, slow end (natural entry)
├── Ease-in: slow start, fast end (natural exit)
└── Ease-in-out: slow both ends (smooth, deliberate)
```

### When to Use Each

| Easing | Best For | Feels Like |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Ease-out** | Elements entering | Arriving, settling |
| **Ease-in** | Elements leaving | Departing, exiting |
| **Ease-in-out** | Emphasis, loops | Deliberate, smooth |
| **Linear** | Continuous motion | Mechanical, constant |
| **Bounce/Elastic** | Playful UI | Fun, energetic |

### The Pattern

```css
/* Entering view = ease-out (decelerate) */
.enter {
  animation-timing-function: ease-out;
}

/* Leaving view = ease-in (accelerate) */
.exit {
  animation-timing-function: ease-in;
}

/* Continuous = ease-in-out */
.continuous {
  animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}
```

## 3. Micro-Interaction Principles

### What Makes Good Micro-Interactions

```
Purpose of micro-interactions:
├── FEEDBACK: Confirm the action happened
├── GUIDANCE: Show what's possible
├── STATUS: Indicate current state
└── DELIGHT: Small moments of joy
```

### Button States

```
Hover → slight visual change (lift, color, scale)
Active → pressed feeling (scale down, shadow change)
Focus → clear indicator (outline, ring)
Loading → progress indicator (spinner, skeleton)
Success → confirmation (check, color)
```

### Principles

1. **Respond immediately** (under 100ms perception)
2. **Match the action** (press = `scale(0.95)`, hover = `translateY(-4px) + glow`)
3. **Be bold but smooth** (Usta işi hissettir)
4. **Be consistent** (same actions = same feedback)

## 4. Loading States Principles

### Types by Context

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Quick load (<1s) | No indicator needed |
| Medium (1-3s) | Spinner or simple animation |
| Long (3s+) | Progress bar or skeleton |
| Unknown duration | Indeterminate indicator |

### Skeleton Screens

```
Purpose: Reduce perceived wait time
├── Show layout shape immediately
├── Animate subtly (shimmer, pulse)
├── Replace with content when ready
└── Feels faster than spinner
```

### Progress Indicators

```
When to show progress:
├── User-initiated action
├── File uploads/downloads
├── Multi-step processes
└── Long operations

When NOT needed:
├── Very quick operations
├── Background tasks
└── Initial page loads (skeleton better)
```

## 5. Page Transitions Principles

### Transition Strategy

```
Simple rule: exit fast, enter slower
├── Outgoing content fades quickly
├── Incoming content animates in
└── Avoids "everything moving at once"
```

### Common Patterns

| Pattern | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fade** | Safe default, works everywhere |
| **Slide** | Sequential navigation (prev/next) |
| **Scale** | Opening/closing modals |
| **Shared element** | Maintaining visual continuity |

### Direction Matching

```
Navigation direction = animation direction
├── Forward → slide from right
├── Backward → slide from left
├── Deeper → scale up from center
├── Back up → scale down
```

---

## Rollback

Restore the baseline if required tooling errors or the procedure introduces a regression.

## Exit Gate

Require fresh evidence for the intended behavior and all applicable project checks.
