# Color System: Palette Generation Principles through 8. Color Selection Checklist

## Scope

Apply only to the declared platforms and repository-confirmed versions.

## Guidance

> Color theory principles, selection process, and decision-making guidelines.
> **No memorized hex codes - learn to THINK about color.**

## 4. Palette Generation Principles

### From a Single Color (HSL Method)

Instead of memorizing hex codes, learn to **manipulate HSL**:

```
HSL = Hue, Saturation, Lightness

Hue (0-360): The color family
  0/360 = Red
  60 = Yellow
  120 = Green
  180 = Cyan
  240 = Blue
  300 = Purple

Saturation (0-100%): Color intensity
  Low = Muted, sophisticated
  High = Vibrant, energetic

Lightness (0-100%): Brightness
  0% = Black
  50% = Pure color
  100% = White
```

### Generating a Full Palette

Given ANY base color, create a scale:

```
Lightness Scale:
  50  (lightest) → L: 97%
  100            → L: 94%
  200            → L: 86%
  300            → L: 74%
  400            → L: 66%
  500 (base)     → L: 50-60%
  600            → L: 48%
  700            → L: 38%
  800            → L: 30%
  900 (darkest)  → L: 20%
```

### Saturation Adjustments

| Context | Saturation Level |
|---------|-----------------|
| **Professional/Corporate** | Lower (40-60%) |
| **Playful/Youth** | Higher (70-90%) |
| **Dark Mode** | Reduce by 10-20% |
| **Accessibility** | Ensure contrast, may need adjustment |

## 5. Context-Based Selection Guide

### Instead of Copying Palettes, Follow This Process:

**Step 1: Identify the Context**
```
What type of project?
├── E-commerce → Need trust + urgency balance
├── SaaS/Dashboard → Need low-fatigue, data focus
├── Health/Wellness → Need calming, natural feel
├── Luxury/Premium → Need understated elegance
├── Creative/Portfolio → Need personality, memorable
└── Other → ASK the user
```

**Step 2: Select Primary Hue Family**
```
Based on context, pick ONE:
- Blue family (trust)
- Green family (growth)
- Warm family (energy)
- Neutral family (elegant)
- OR ask user preference
```

**Step 3: Decide Light/Dark Mode**
```
Consider:
- User preference?
- Industry standard?
- Content type? (text-heavy = light preferred)
- Time of use? (evening app = dark option)
```

**Step 4: Generate Palette Using Principles**
- Use HSL manipulation
- Follow 60-30-10 rule
- Check contrast (WCAG)
- Test with actual content

## 6. Dark Mode Principles

### Key Rules (No Fixed Codes)

1. **Never pure black** → Use very dark gray with slight hue
2. **Never pure white text** → Use 87-92% lightness
3. **Reduce saturation** → Vibrant colors strain eyes in dark mode
4. **Elevation = brightness** → Higher elements slightly lighter

### Contrast in Dark Mode

```
Background layers (darker → lighter as elevation increases):
Layer 0 (base)    → Darkest
Layer 1 (cards)   → Slightly lighter
Layer 2 (modals)  → Even lighter
Layer 3 (popups)  → Lightest dark
```

### Adapting Colors for Dark Mode

| Light Mode | Dark Mode Adjustment |
|------------|---------------------|
| High saturation accent | Reduce saturation 10-20% |
| Pure white background | Dark gray with brand hue tint |
| Black text | Light gray (not pure white) |
| Colorful backgrounds | Desaturated, darker versions |

## 7. Accessibility Guidelines

### Contrast Requirements (WCAG)

| Level | Normal Text | Large Text |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| AA (minimum) | 4.5:1 | 3:1 |
| AAA (enhanced) | 7:1 | 4.5:1 |

### How to Check Contrast

1. **Convert colors to luminance**
2. **Calculate ratio**: (lighter + 0.05) / (darker + 0.05)
3. **Adjust until ratio meets requirement**

### Safe Patterns

| Use Case | Guideline |
|----------|-----------|
| **Text on light bg** | Use lightness 35% or less |
| **Text on dark bg** | Use lightness 85% or more |
| **Primary on white** | Ensure dark enough variant |
| **Buttons** | High contrast between bg and text |

## 8. Color Selection Checklist

Before finalizing any color choice, verify:

- [ ] **Asked user preference?** (if not specified)
- [ ] **Matches project context?** (industry, audience)
- [ ] **Follows 60-30-10?** (proper distribution)
- [ ] **WCAG compliant?** (contrast checked)
- [ ] **Works in both modes?** (if dark mode needed)
- [ ] **NOT your default/favorite?** (variety check)
- [ ] **Different from last project?** (avoid repetition)

## Verification

Cross-check version-sensitive details with the cited official source and verify behavior in the target environment.
