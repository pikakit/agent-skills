# Visual Effects: Border Effects Principles through 10. Effect Selection Checklist

## Scope

Apply only to the declared platforms and repository-confirmed versions.

## Guidance

> Modern CSS effect principles and techniques - learn the concepts, create variations.
> **No fixed values to copy - understand the patterns.**

---

## 5. Border Effects Principles

### Gradient Borders

```
Technique: Pseudo-element with gradient background
├── Element has padding = border width
├── Pseudo-element fills with gradient
└── Mask or clip creates border effect
```

### Animated Borders

```
Technique: Rotating gradient or conic sweep
├── Pseudo-element larger than content
├── Animation rotates the gradient
└── Overflow hidden clips to shape
```

### Glow Borders

```css
/* Multiple box-shadows create glow */
box-shadow:
  0 0 SMALL-BLUR COLOR,
  0 0 MEDIUM-BLUR COLOR,
  0 0 LARGE-BLUR COLOR;

/* Each layer adds to the glow */
```

> **No fixed values to copy - understand the patterns.**

## 6. Glow Effects Principles

### Text Glow

```css
text-shadow: 
  0 0 BLUR-1 COLOR,
  0 0 BLUR-2 COLOR,
  0 0 BLUR-3 COLOR;

/* Multiple layers = stronger glow */
/* Larger blur = softer spread */
```

### Element Glow

```css
box-shadow:
  0 0 BLUR-1 COLOR,
  0 0 BLUR-2 COLOR;

/* Use color matching element for realistic glow */
/* Lower opacity for subtle, higher for neon */
```

### Pulsing Glow Animation

```css
@keyframes glow-pulse {
  0%, 100% { box-shadow: 0 0 SMALL-BLUR COLOR; }
  50% { box-shadow: 0 0 LARGE-BLUR COLOR; }
}

/* Easing and duration affect feel */
```

## 7. Overlay Techniques

### Gradient Overlay on Images

```
Purpose: Improve text readability over images
Pattern: Gradient from transparent to opaque
Position: Where text will appear
```

```css
.overlay::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background: linear-gradient(
    DIRECTION,
    transparent PERCENTAGE,
    rgba(0,0,0,OPACITY) 100%
  );
}
```

### Colored Overlay

```css
/* Blend mode or layered gradient */
background: 
  linear-gradient(YOUR-COLOR-WITH-OPACITY),
  url('image.jpg');
```

## 8. Modern CSS Techniques

### Container Queries (Concept)

```
Instead of viewport breakpoints:
├── Component responds to ITS container
├── Truly modular, reusable components
└── Syntax: @container (condition) { }
```

### :has() Selector (Concept)

```
Parent styling based on children:
├── "Parent that has X child"
├── Enables previously impossible patterns
└── Progressive enhancement approach
```

### Scroll-Driven Animations (Concept)

```
Animation progress tied to scroll:
├── Entry/exit animations on scroll
├── Parallax effects
├── Progress indicators
└── View-based or scroll-based timeline
```

## 9. Performance Principles

### GPU-Accelerated Properties

```
CHEAP to animate (GPU):
├── transform (translate, scale, rotate)
└── opacity

EXPENSIVE to animate (CPU):
├── width, height
├── top, left, right, bottom
├── margin, padding
└── box-shadow (recalculates)
```

### will-change Usage

```css
/* Use sparingly, only for heavy animations */
.heavy-animation {
  will-change: transform;
}

/* Remove after animation if possible */
```

### Reduced Motion

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Disable or minimize animations */
  /* Respect user preference */
}
```

## 10. Effect Selection Checklist

Before applying any effect:

- [ ] **Does it serve a purpose?** (not just decoration)
- [ ] **Is it appropriate for the context?** (brand, audience)
- [ ] **Have you varied from previous projects?** (avoid repetition)
- [ ] **Is it accessible?** (contrast, motion sensitivity)
- [ ] **Is it performant?** (especially on mobile)
- [ ] **Did you ask user preference?** (if style open-ended)

### Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Glassmorphism on every element (kitsch)
- ❌ Dark + neon as default (lazy AI look)
- ❌ **Static/Flat designs with no depth (FAILED)**
- ❌ Effects that hurt readability
- ❌ Animations without purpose

---

> **Remember**: Effects enhance meaning. Choose based on purpose and context, not because it "looks cool."

## Verification

Cross-check version-sensitive details with the cited official source and verify behavior in the target environment.
