# Game Development — Engineering Specification

> Production-grade specification for game development orchestration and core principles at FAANG scale.

---

## 1. Overview

Game Development provides two functions: (1) deterministic routing to 10 platform-specific and specialty sub-skills, and (2) universal game development principles applicable across all platforms — game loop architecture, pattern selection, performance budgets, input abstraction, AI selection, and collision strategies. The skill operates as an **Orchestrator** — it analyzes project requirements and routes to the correct sub-skill(s). Sub-skills are self-contained SKILL.md files in subdirectories.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Game development orchestration at scale faces four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Wrong engine/framework selection | 35% of game projects restart due to platform mismatch | Wasted development time |
| No fixed performance budget | 50% of games exceed 16.67ms frame time at launch | Frame drops, poor UX |
| Variable timestep physics | 40% of games use delta time for physics | Non-deterministic simulation |
| Unstructured input handling | 55% of games hardcode key bindings | No multi-platform support |

Game Development eliminates these with deterministic sub-skill routing, fixed 60 FPS (16.67ms) budget, fixed timestep physics, and input abstraction.

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | Deterministic routing | Platform + dimension → exact sub-skill(s) |
| G2 | 60 FPS frame budget | 16.67ms total; per-system budgets defined |
| G3 | Fixed timestep physics | Physics at fixed rate (50Hz); render interpolated |
| G4 | Input abstraction | Actions, not raw keys; rebindable by design |
| G5 | Pattern selection | Use case → pattern (State Machine default) |
| G6 | AI selection by complexity | FSM → Behavior Tree → GOAP → Utility AI |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | Engine installation or configuration | Infrastructure concern |
| NG2 | Platform-specific implementation details | Owned by sub-skills |
| NG3 | Asset creation (art, audio) | Owned by game-art, game-audio sub-skills |
| NG4 | Multiplayer network code | Owned by multiplayer sub-skill |
| NG5 | Mobile store submission | Owned by mobile-developer skill |
| NG6 | Shader programming | Owned by shader skill |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Sub-skill routing (10 sub-skills) | Routing decision tree | Sub-skill content |
| Game loop architecture (INPUT→UPDATE→RENDER) | Pattern definition | Engine-specific implementation |
| Performance budget (16.67ms at 60 FPS) | Budget allocation | Profiling tools |
| Pattern selection matrix (6 patterns) | Selection criteria | Pattern implementation |
| AI selection (4 complexity levels) | Decision tree | AI implementation |
| Collision strategy selection (4 types) | Selection criteria | Physics implementation |
| Input abstraction principle | Convention definition | Input system configuration |

**Side-effect boundary:** Game Development produces routing decisions and pattern recommendations. It does not create files, install engines, or invoke sub-skills automatically. The caller reads the recommended sub-skill.

---

## 6. Integration Model

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Routing is deterministic: platform → primary sub-skill; dimension → secondary sub-skill.
- Performance budget is fixed per target FPS (16.67ms at 60 FPS, 33.33ms at 30 FPS).
- Physics timestep is always fixed rate (50Hz default); render always interpolated.
- Pattern selection defaults to State Machine; ECS only when entity_count = "high".
- AI selection is monotonic with complexity: simple → FSM, medium → Behavior Tree, high → GOAP/Utility AI.
- Collision type selection: rectangles → AABB, round → Circle, many same-size → Spatial Hash, large world → Quadtree.

#### What Agents May Assume

- Primary sub-skill path is valid and contains a SKILL.md.
- Performance budget sums to exactly the frame time.
- Game loop pattern is universal across all platforms.
- Input abstraction applies to all sub-skills.

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- Sub-skills are automatically invoked (caller must read them).
- Engine is installed or configured.
- Performance budget applies to non-game workloads.
- AI selection produces implementation code.

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| Route | None; routing decision |
| Game loop | None; pattern recommendation |
| Pattern select | None; decision output |
| Perf budget | None; budget allocation |
| AI select | None; decision output |
| Collision select | None; decision output |
| Input guide | None; convention output |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Invocation Pattern

```
1. Define platform, dimension, and specialty requirements
2. Invoke "route" to identify sub-skills
3. Read primary sub-skill SKILL.md (caller's responsibility)
4. Invoke "game-loop" for architecture pattern
5. Invoke "perf-budget" for frame time allocation
6. Invoke specialty queries (ai-select, collision-select) as needed
7. Implement game (caller's responsibility)
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Each invocation produces a complete recommendation.
- Routing always returns at least one primary sub-skill.
- Performance budget always totals to target frame time.

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Invalid platform | Return error to caller | Use supported platform |
| Invalid dimension | Return error to caller | Use "2d" or "3d" |
| Sub-skill not found | Return error to caller | Verify installation |
| Unsupported FPS target | Return error to caller | Use 30, 60, or 120 |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Zero internal retries. Deterministic output.

#### Isolation Model

- Each invocation is stateless and independent.

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Route | Yes | Same platform + dimension = same sub-skills |
| Game loop | Yes | Fixed pattern |
| Perf budget | Yes | Same FPS = same allocation |
| Pattern select | Yes | Same entity_count = same pattern |
| AI select | Yes | Same complexity = same type |
| Collision select | Yes | Same context = same type |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 2-Phase Lifecycle

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Parse** | Validate platform, dimension, context | Validated input or error |
| **Route/Evaluate** | Route to sub-skills or evaluate decision tree | Recommendation |

All phases synchronous. No async pipeline. No sub-skill invocation.

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fixed routing table | Platform → sub-skill mapping is fixed (10 sub-skills) |
| Fixed frame budget | 60 FPS = 16.67ms; per-system allocation is fixed |
| Fixed timestep | Physics at 50Hz; rendering interpolated; no variable delta |
| State Machine default | Always start with State Machine; ECS only for 1000+ entities |
| Input abstraction | Actions (jump, move), never raw keys (Space, W) |
| Escalating AI | FSM → Behavior Tree → GOAP → Utility AI by complexity |
| No external calls | All decisions use embedded rules |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

Stateless. Fully idempotent. No persistent state.

The orchestrator routes but does not invoke. No pipeline state, no session tracking.

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Unknown platform | Return `ERR_INVALID_PLATFORM` | Use web/mobile/pc/vr-ar |
| Unknown dimension | Return `ERR_INVALID_DIMENSION` | Use 2d/3d |
| Sub-skill missing | Return `ERR_SUBSKILL_NOT_FOUND` | Verify directory |
| Unsupported FPS | Return `ERR_INVALID_FPS` | Use 30/60/120 |
| Missing context | Return `ERR_MISSING_CONTEXT` | Supply required fields |

**Invariant:** Every failure returns a structured error. No silent routing to default sub-skill.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `ERR_INVALID_PLATFORM` | Validation | No | Platform not supported |
| `ERR_INVALID_DIMENSION` | Validation | No | Dimension not 2d or 3d |
| `ERR_INVALID_FPS` | Validation | No | FPS target not 30/60/120 |
| `ERR_SUBSKILL_NOT_FOUND` | Infrastructure | No | Sub-skill directory missing |
| `ERR_MISSING_CONTEXT` | Validation | Yes | Required context field missing |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Decision timeout | N/A | N/A | Synchronous; < 50ms |
| Internal retries | Zero | Zero | Deterministic output |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema

### OpenTelemetry Observability (MANDATORY)

- **Routing Telemetry**: EVERY time the Orchestrator makes a routing decision (platform + dimension → sub-skill), it MUST emit an OpenTelemetry Span recording `routing_latency` to track decision speed.
- **Analytics Events**: The Orchestrator MUST trigger an OTel Event detailing the selected context (platform, dimension, specialty, target_fps) whenever a sub-skill is activated, to feed FAANG-grade usage analytics.

### Log Entry Format

```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "skill_name": "game-development",
  "contract_version": "2.0.0",
  "execution_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "request_type": "string",
  "platform": "string",
  "dimension": "string",
  "primary_subskill": "string|null",
  "secondary_subskills": "Array<string>|null",
  "target_fps": "number",
  "status": "success|error",
  "error_code": "string|null",
  "duration_ms": "number"
}
```

### Required Log Points

| Event | Log Level | Fields |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Routing decision | INFO | platform, dimension, primary_subskill |
| Multi-sub-skill route | INFO | all sub-skills listed |
| Decision failed | ERROR | error_code, message |

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Unit |
|--------|------|------|
| `gamedev.route.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `gamedev.platform.distribution` | Counter | per platform |
| `gamedev.dimension.distribution` | Counter | per dimension |
| `gamedev.subskill.selected` | Counter | per sub-skill |

---

## 14. Security & Trust Model

### Data Handling

- Game Development does not access game engines, APIs, or user data.
- Platform and dimension inputs are treated as enum values.
- No credential handling, no PII processing, no network access.

---

## 15. Scalability Model

| Dimension | Constraint | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Throughput | CPU-bound routing | < 50ms; scales linearly |
| Concurrency | Stateless invocations | Unlimited parallel |
| Sub-skill count | 10 sub-skill directories | Static; grows only via skill additions |
| Memory per invocation | < 1 MB | No accumulation |
| Network | Zero network calls | No external dependency |

---

## 16. Concurrency Model

Fully parallel. No shared state. No coordination required.

---

## 17. Resource Lifecycle Management

All resources scoped to invocation. No persistent handles.

Sub-skill SKILL.md files are read by the caller, not by this skill.

---

## 18. Performance Constraints

| Operation | P50 Target | P99 Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Routing decision | < 2 ms | < 5 ms | 20 ms |
| Full guide | < 10 ms | < 30 ms | 50 ms |
| Output size | ≤ 1,000 chars | ≤ 3,000 chars | 5,000 chars |

---

## 19. Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Sub-skill directory missing | Low | Routing fails | `ERR_SUBSKILL_NOT_FOUND` with directory path |
| Wrong platform selection | Medium | Wrong framework | Decision tree forces explicit choice |
| ECS overuse | Medium | Over-engineering | State Machine default; ECS only for 1000+ entities |
| Variable timestep | High | Non-deterministic physics | Fixed timestep mandated (50Hz) |
| Frame budget exceeded | High | Frame drops | Per-system budget with buffer (1.67ms) |
