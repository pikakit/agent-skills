# Git Workflow — Engineering Specification

> Production-grade specification for git operations with conventional commits and secret detection at FAANG scale.

---

## 1. Overview

Git Workflow provides automated git operations: staging, conventional commits, push, PR creation, and merge — with mandatory secret detection before every commit. The skill operates as an **Automation (scripted)** skill — it executes shell commands (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) with side effects on the git index, working tree, local repository, and remote. It includes commit splitting logic and output formatting.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Git workflow at scale faces four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Secrets committed to repos | 1 in 200 commits contains leaked credentials | Security breaches |
| Non-conventional commit messages | 40% of commits lack type/scope format | Unreadable changelog, broken automation |
| Monolithic commits | 35% of commits mix features, fixes, and config | Impossible to bisect or revert |
| Push failures without recovery | 25% of rejected pushes lead to force-push | History corruption |

Git Workflow eliminates these with mandatory secret scanning, enforced conventional commit format, auto-split logic, and rebase-before-push recovery.

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | Zero secrets committed | Regex scan blocks commit if match found |
| G2 | 100% conventional format | `type(scope): description` enforced |
| G3 | Commit splitting | Split if: >10 unrelated files OR mixed types OR multiple scopes |
| G4 | Single commit threshold | ≤ 3 files AND ≤ 50 lines AND same type/scope |
| G5 | Clean push recovery | `git pull --rebase` on push rejection |
| G6 | Structured output | Fixed format: staged, security, commit, pushed |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | CI/CD pipeline configuration | Owned by `cicd-pipeline` skill |
| NG2 | Code review process | Owned by `code-review` skill |
| NG3 | GitOps deployment (ArgoCD/Flux) | Owned by `gitops-workflow` skill |
| NG4 | Git server administration | Infrastructure concern |
| NG5 | Advanced merge strategies (octopus, subtree) | Rare; manual |
| NG6 | Git LFS management | Specialized concern |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `git add` (staging) | Staging files for commit | File creation |
| `git commit` (conventional format) | Commit message formatting + execution | Commit content validation |
| `git push` (with rebase recovery) | Push + recovery on rejection | Remote server |
| `git diff --cached` (secret scan) | Regex pattern matching | Secret rotation |
| Commit splitting decision | Split criteria (files, types, scopes) | File grouping logic |
| PR creation | `gh pr create` invocation | PR review process |

**Side-effect boundary:** Git Workflow modifies: git index, local repository, remote repository (push), and stdout (output). Cannot be undone once pushed to remote.

---

## 6. Integration Model

### 6.1 Agent Contract

#### Input Schema

```
Request_Type: string          # "cm" | "cp" | "pr" | "merge" | "status"
Context: {
  message: string | null      # Commit message (auto-generated if null)
  scope: string | null        # Commit scope
  type: string | null         # Commit type (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
  files: Array<string> | null # Specific files to stage (null = all)
  branch: string | null       # Target branch for merge/PR
  force: boolean              # Force push (requires explicit approval)
  skip_security: boolean      # Skip secret scan (FORBIDDEN in production)
}
contract_version: string      # "2.0.0"
```

#### Output Schema

```
Status: "success" | "blocked" | "error"
Data: {
  staged: {
    file_count: number
    additions: number
    deletions: number
  } | null
  security: {
    passed: boolean
    violations: Array<{
      file: string
      line: number
      pattern: string         # Which secret pattern matched
    }>
  } | null
  commit: {
    hash: string              # Short commit hash
    message: string           # Full conventional commit message
    type: string
    scope: string | null
  } | null
  pushed: boolean
  split_recommendation: {
    should_split: boolean
    reason: string
    suggested_groups: Array<{
      type: string
      scope: string
      files: Array<string>
    }>
  } | null
  metadata: {
    contract_version: string
    backward_compatibility: string
  }
}
Error: ErrorSchema | null
```

#### Error Schema

```
Code: string                  # From Error Taxonomy (Section 11)
Message: string
Request_Type: string
Recoverable: boolean
```

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Secret scan patterns are fixed: `API_KEY`, `token`, `password`, `secret`, `private_key`, `credentials`.
- Conventional commit format is fixed: `type(scope): description`.
- Commit types are fixed: 9 types (feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build).
- Split threshold is fixed: >10 unrelated files OR mixed types OR multiple scopes.
- Single commit threshold: ≤ 3 files AND ≤ 50 lines AND same type/scope.
- Push rejection recovery is always `git pull --rebase`.

#### What Agents May Assume

- Secret scan runs before every commit (never skipped in production).
- Conventional commit message is properly formatted.
- Push rejection triggers rebase recovery exactly once.
- Output format is fixed and parseable.

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- Push is always successful (remote may reject).
- Force push is allowed without explicit user approval.
- Secret detection catches all credential formats (regex-based, not entropy-based).
- Merge conflicts resolve automatically.

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| cm (stage + commit) | Git index modified, local commit created |
| cp (stage + commit + push) | Git index, local commit, remote updated |
| pr (create PR) | Remote PR created via `gh` CLI |
| merge | Branch merged, local repository modified |
| status | None; read-only `git status` |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Invocation Pattern

```
1. Stage files (git add -A or specific files)
2. Run secret scan on staged diff
3. If secrets found → BLOCK, return violations
4. If clean → format conventional commit message
5. Check split criteria → recommend split if needed
6. Commit with conventional format
7. Push if requested (cp command)
8. If push rejected → git pull --rebase → retry push once
```

#### State Transitions

```
IDLE → STAGING              [cm/cp invoked]
STAGING → SCANNING          [files staged]
SCANNING → BLOCKED          [secrets detected]  // terminal — user must fix
SCANNING → FORMATTING       [scan passed]
FORMATTING → SPLITTING      [message formatted]
SPLITTING → COMMITTING      [single commit decided]
SPLITTING → SPLIT_NEEDED    [split recommended]  // terminal — user must split
COMMITTING → PUSHING        [cp command, commit done]
COMMITTING → COMPLETED      [cm command, commit done]  // terminal
PUSHING → REBASING          [push rejected]
PUSHING → COMPLETED         [push accepted]  // terminal
REBASING → PUSHING          [rebase succeeded, retry push]
REBASING → CONFLICT         [rebase has conflicts]  // terminal — manual resolution
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Secret scan ALWAYS runs before commit (no bypass in production).
- Push rejection triggers exactly 1 rebase attempt, then fails.
- Output format is always emitted, even on failure.

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Secrets detected | BLOCK commit | User removes secrets |
| No changes staged | Return clean exit | No action needed |
| Push rejected | Auto-rebase once | If still fails → return error |
| Merge conflicts | Return conflict | Manual resolution |
| Git not installed | Return error | Install git |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Push: exactly 1 retry after rebase. No further retries.
- Commit: zero retries (deterministic).
- Secret scan: zero retries.

#### Isolation Model

- Each invocation operates on the current git working directory.
- Multiple concurrent git operations on the same repo are NOT safe.

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| cm (stage + commit) | No | Creates new commit each time |
| cp (stage + commit + push) | No | New commit + push |
| pr | No | Creates new PR |
| merge | No | Modifies branch history |
| status | Yes | Read-only |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 4-Phase Lifecycle

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Stage** | `git add` files | Staged file count |
| **Scan** | Regex match on `git diff --cached` | Pass or violations |
| **Commit** | `git commit -m "type(scope): desc"` | Commit hash |
| **Push** | `git push origin HEAD` (if requested) | Success or rejection |

Phases are sequential. Scan blocks Commit. Push is optional.

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fixed secret patterns | 6 patterns: API_KEY, token, password, secret, private_key, credentials |
| Fixed commit types | 9 types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore, perf, ci, build |
| Fixed commit format | `type(scope): description` — no deviations |
| Fixed split threshold | >10 files OR mixed types OR multiple scopes → split |
| Fixed single threshold | ≤ 3 files AND ≤ 50 lines AND same type/scope → single |
| Fixed push recovery | `git pull --rebase` exactly once on rejection |
| Security-first | Scan before commit; no skip in production |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

Session-based. Not idempotent. Git state is modified by every commit/push.

| State | Persistent | Scope |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Git index (staged files) | Yes | Until reset |
| Local commits | Yes | Until revert |
| Remote commits (after push) | Yes | Permanent (without force) |
| Secret scan results | No | Per invocation |

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Secrets in staged diff | Return `ERR_SECRETS_DETECTED` + file list | Remove secrets, add to .gitignore |
| No changes to commit | Return `ERR_NOTHING_TO_COMMIT` | Stage files first |
| Push rejected | Auto-rebase once, then `ERR_PUSH_REJECTED` | Manual pull/merge |
| Merge conflicts | Return `ERR_MERGE_CONFLICT` | Manual resolution |
| Git not installed | Return `ERR_GIT_NOT_FOUND` | Install git |
| Invalid commit type | Return `ERR_INVALID_TYPE` | Use supported type |

**Invariant:** Secrets ALWAYS block the commit. No override path in production.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `ERR_SECRETS_DETECTED` | Security | Yes | Credentials found in staged diff |
| `ERR_NOTHING_TO_COMMIT` | Validation | Yes | No staged changes |
| `ERR_PUSH_REJECTED` | Network | Yes | Remote rejected push after rebase |
| `ERR_MERGE_CONFLICT` | Git | Yes | Merge conflict requires manual resolution |
| `ERR_GIT_NOT_FOUND` | Infrastructure | No | Git not installed |
| `ERR_INVALID_TYPE` | Validation | Yes | Commit type not in allowed list |
| `ERR_FORCE_PUSH_DENIED` | Security | No | Force push without approval |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Stage timeout | 10,000 ms | 30,000 ms | Large repos |
| Secret scan timeout | 5,000 ms | 15,000 ms | Diff scanning |
| Commit timeout | 5,000 ms | 10,000 ms | Local operation |
| Push timeout | 30,000 ms | 60,000 ms | Network dependent |
| Rebase timeout | 15,000 ms | 30,000 ms | Local + possible fetch |
| Push retries after rebase | 1 | 1 | Exactly one retry |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema

### Log Entry Format

```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "skill_name": "git-workflow",
  "contract_version": "2.0.0",
  "execution_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "request_type": "string",
  "files_staged": "number",
  "security_passed": "boolean",
  "secrets_found": "number",
  "commit_hash": "string|null",
  "commit_type": "string|null",
  "pushed": "boolean",
  "rebase_attempted": "boolean",
  "status": "success|blocked|error",
  "error_code": "string|null",
  "duration_ms": "number"
}
```

### Required Log Points

| Event | Log Level | Fields |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Files staged | INFO | files_staged, additions, deletions |
| Security scan passed | INFO | security_passed |
| Secrets detected | CRITICAL | secrets_found, files, patterns |
| Commit created | INFO | commit_hash, commit_type, message |
| Push succeeded | INFO | pushed |
| Push rejected | WARN | error_code |
| Rebase attempted | WARN | rebase_attempted |
| Force push denied | CRITICAL | error_code |

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Unit |
|--------|------|------|
| `gitworkflow.commit.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `gitworkflow.secrets.detected` | Counter | per scan |
| `gitworkflow.push.rejection_rate` | Gauge | 0.0-1.0 |
| `gitworkflow.commit_type.distribution` | Counter | per type |
| `gitworkflow.split.recommended` | Counter | per invocation |

---

## 14. Security & Trust Model

### Secret Detection

- 6 regex patterns scanned on every `git diff --cached`.
- Patterns: `API_KEY`, `token`, `password`, `secret`, `private_key`, `credentials` (case-insensitive).
- Detection blocks commit — no bypass in production.
- `skip_security: true` is FORBIDDEN unless explicitly approved by user and documented.

### Force Push Protection

- Force push (`--force`) requires explicit user approval.
- Without approval: `ERR_FORCE_PUSH_DENIED`.

### Credential Exposure

- Git Workflow does not store, log, or transmit credential values.
- Violation log entries reference file + line, not the actual secret.

---

## 15. Scalability Model

| Dimension | Constraint | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Throughput | I/O bound (git operations) | Sequential per repo |
| Diff scan | File count dependent | 5s default timeout |
| Push | Network dependent | 30s default timeout |
| Concurrent repos | Independent | One operation per repo |
| Large diffs | Regex scan on full cached diff | 15s max scan timeout |

---

## 16. Concurrency Model

Single-threaded per repository. Concurrent git operations on the same repository are NOT safe due to git index locking.

| Dimension | Boundary |
|-----------|----------|
| Operations per repo | 1 (sequential) |
| Concurrent repos | Unlimited (independent) |
| Git index lock | Owned by current operation |
| Shared state | Git index, working tree |

---

## 17. Resource Lifecycle Management

| Resource | Created By | Destroyed By | Max Lifetime |
|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Git index lock | Stage phase | Commit/push completion | Operation duration |
| Staged changes | Stage phase | Commit or reset | Until next operation |
| Local commit | Commit phase | Revert (manual) | Permanent |
| Remote commit | Push phase | Force push (manual) | Permanent |
| Secret scan results | Scan phase | End of invocation | Single invocation |

**Critical invariant:** Git index lock MUST be released after every operation, including failures.

---

## 18. Performance Constraints

| Operation | P50 Target | P99 Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Stage (small repo) | < 500 ms | < 2,000 ms | 10,000 ms |
| Stage (large repo) | < 2,000 ms | < 10,000 ms | 30,000 ms |
| Secret scan | < 1,000 ms | < 5,000 ms | 15,000 ms |
| Commit | < 500 ms | < 2,000 ms | 10,000 ms |
| Push (network) | < 5,000 ms | < 20,000 ms | 60,000 ms |

---

## 19. Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Secret bypass | Low (blocked by default) | Credential leak | No production override |
| Monolithic commits | Medium | Hard to revert | Split recommendation with threshold |
| Push rejection loop | Low | Blocked progress | Exactly 1 rebase retry |
| Merge conflicts | Medium | Manual work | Return conflict details |
| Force push data loss | Low | History corruption | Approval required; `ERR_FORCE_PUSH_DENIED` |
| Git index lock stale | Low | Blocked operations | Lock released on all exit paths |
