# GitOps Workflow â€” Declarative Kubernetes Delivery

> Git is the single source of truth. Continuous reconciliation. No auto-sync to production.

---

## Prerequisites

**Required:** Kubernetes cluster, `kubectl`, ArgoCD or Flux installed.

---

## When to Use

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| K8s deployment needed | Choose ArgoCD or Flux via decision tree |
| CD pipeline setup | Configure sync policies per environment |
| Secret management | Use Sealed Secrets or External Secrets (no plaintext) |
| Multi-environment | Set up staging â†’ production promotion |
| Architecture review | Read `rules/engineering-spec.md` |

---

## System Boundaries

| Owned by This Skill | NOT Owned |
|---------------------|-----------|
| ArgoCD vs Flux decision (4 criteria) | CI pipeline (â†’ cicd-pipeline) |
| Sync policy selection (4 policies) | Server management (â†’ server-ops) |
| Repository structure template | Git operations (â†’ git-workflow) |
| OpenGitOps compliance (4 principles) | Cluster provisioning |
| Secret management strategy | Helm chart development |

**Expert decision skill:** Produces architecture decisions. No cluster modifications.

---

## OpenGitOps Principles (4 â€” All Required)

| # | Principle | Requirement |
|---|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Declarative | Entire system described declaratively |
| 2 | Versioned | Desired state stored in Git |
| 3 | Pulled | Agents pull desired state (not pushed) |
| 4 | Reconciled | Agents continuously reconcile actual vs desired |

---

## ArgoCD vs Flux Decision Tree

| Criterion | ArgoCD | Flux |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Web UI | âœ… Rich dashboard | âŒ CLI only |
| Multi-cluster | âœ… Native support | âš ï¸ Requires setup |
| Helm support | âœ… Native | âœ… Native |
| Learning curve | Medium | Lower |

**Rule:** needs_ui=true OR cluster_count>1 â†’ **ArgoCD**. Otherwise â†’ **Flux**.

---

## Sync Policies (4)

| Policy | Environment | Behavior |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Manual** | Production | Requires explicit approval |
| **Auto** | Dev, Staging | Deploys on Git push |
| **Prune** | All | Removes resources not in Git |
| **Self-Heal** | All | Reverts manual cluster changes |

**Safety:** Production is ALWAYS manual sync. No exceptions.

---

## Repository Structure

```
gitops-repo/
â”œâ”€â”€ apps/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ production/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ staging/
â”œâ”€â”€ infrastructure/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ingress-nginx/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ cert-manager/
â””â”€â”€ argocd/
    â””â”€â”€ applications/
```

---

## Safety Rules (Non-Negotiable)

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| No auto-sync to production | Sync policy = manual |
| No secrets in Git | Sealed Secrets / External Secrets |
| Rollback tested | Rollback procedure in promotion workflow |

---

## Error Taxonomy

| Code | Recoverable | Trigger |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_MISSING_CLUSTER_COUNT` | Yes | Cluster count not provided |
| `ERR_MISSING_ENVIRONMENTS` | Yes | Environment list not provided |
| `ERR_INVALID_ENVIRONMENT` | Yes | Environment name not recognized |
| `ERR_REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` | No | Reference file missing |

**Zero internal retries.** Deterministic; same context = same recommendation.

---

## Anti-Patterns

| âŒ Don't | âœ… Do |
|---------|-------|
| Auto-sync to production | Manual sync with approval |
| Store secrets in Git | Sealed Secrets / External Secrets |
| Push-based deployment | Pull-based reconciliation |
| Skip rollback testing | Test rollback on every release |
| Use imperative `kubectl apply` | Declarative manifests in Git |

---

## Rule Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Argocd | LOW | `argocd-` |
| 2 | Engineering Spec | LOW | `engineering-` |
| 3 | Sync | LOW | `sync-` |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Argocd (LOW)

- `argocd-setup` - ArgoCD Setup and Configuration

### 2. Engineering Spec (LOW)

- `engineering-spec` - GitOps Workflow â€” Engineering Specification

### 3. Sync (LOW)

- `sync-policies` - GitOps Sync Policies

## How to Use

Read individual rule files for detailed explanations and code examples:

```
rules/argocd-setup.md
rules/engineering-spec.md
```

Each rule file contains:
- Brief explanation of why it matters
- Incorrect code example with explanation
- Correct code example with explanation
- Additional context and references
