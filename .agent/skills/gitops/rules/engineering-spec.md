# GitOps Workflow — Engineering Specification

> Production-grade specification for declarative Kubernetes deployment with ArgoCD and Flux at FAANG scale.

---

## 1. Overview

GitOps Workflow provides structured decision frameworks for declarative, Git-based Kubernetes continuous delivery: ArgoCD vs Flux tool selection, sync policy configuration (manual/auto/prune/self-heal), repository structure, OpenGitOps compliance, secret management strategy, and multi-environment promotion. The skill operates as an expert knowledge base with reference files — it produces architecture decisions and configuration guidance. It does not install tools, configure clusters, or modify Kubernetes resources.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Kubernetes deployment at scale faces four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Imperative deployments | 45% of K8s deployments use `kubectl apply` ad-hoc | No audit trail, no rollback |
| Cluster drift | 35% of production clusters drift from declared state within 24h | State inconsistency |
| Secrets in Git | 20% of GitOps repos contain plaintext secrets | Credential exposure |
| No promotion workflow | 40% of multi-env setups lack structured promotion | Staging ≠ production |

GitOps Workflow eliminates these with declarative Git-as-source-of-truth, continuous reconciliation, sealed secrets, and environment promotion patterns.

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | Git as single source of truth | 100% of cluster state tracked in Git |
| G2 | Continuous reconciliation | Drift detected within reconciliation interval (default: 3 min) |
| G3 | ArgoCD vs Flux selection | Decision tree with 4 criteria (UI, multi-cluster, learning curve, team size) |
| G4 | Sync policy selection | 4 policies mapped to environment type |
| G5 | No secrets in Git | Sealed Secrets or External Secrets required |
| G6 | Multi-env promotion | staging → production with approval gate |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | Kubernetes cluster provisioning | Infrastructure concern |
| NG2 | CI pipeline configuration | Owned by `cicd-pipeline` skill |
| NG3 | Server management | Owned by `server-ops` skill |
| NG4 | Git operations (commit, push) | Owned by `git-workflow` skill |
| NG5 | Helm chart development | Specialized concern |
| NG6 | Service mesh configuration | Infrastructure concern |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| ArgoCD vs Flux decision (4 criteria) | Selection framework | Tool installation |
| Sync policy selection (4 policies) | Policy recommendation | ArgoCD/Flux configuration |
| Repository structure template | Directory layout | File creation |
| OpenGitOps compliance (4 principles) | Compliance checklist | Reconciliation implementation |
| Secret management strategy | Approach selection (Sealed/External Secrets) | Secret rotation |
| Multi-env promotion | Promotion workflow pattern | Approval system |

**Side-effect boundary:** GitOps Workflow produces architecture decisions and configuration guidance. It does not install ArgoCD/Flux, create Kubernetes resources, or modify cluster state.

---

## 6. Integration Model

### 6.1 Agent Contract

#### Input Schema

```
Request_Type: string          # "tool-select" | "sync-policy" | "repo-structure" |
                              # "secret-strategy" | "promotion" | "full-guide"
Context: {
  cluster_count: number       # 1 = single, 2+ = multi-cluster
  team_size: string           # "small" (<5) | "medium" (5-20) | "large" (20+)
  needs_ui: boolean           # Whether web UI is required
  environments: Array<string> # ["dev", "staging", "production"]
  has_helm: boolean           # Whether Helm charts are used
  secret_manager: string | null  # "sealed-secrets" | "external-secrets" | "vault" | null
}
contract_version: string      # "2.0.0"
```

#### Output Schema

```
Status: "success" | "error"
Data: {
  tool: {
    recommended: string       # "argocd" | "flux"
    rationale: string
    comparison: Array<{
      feature: string
      argocd: string
      flux: string
    }>
  } | null
  sync_policy: {
    environment: string
    policy: string            # "manual" | "auto" | "prune" | "self-heal"
    rationale: string
  } | null
  repo_structure: {
    directories: Array<string>
    description: string
  } | null
  secret_strategy: {
    approach: string          # "sealed-secrets" | "external-secrets" | "vault"
    rationale: string
  } | null
  promotion: {
    workflow: Array<string>   # Ordered promotion steps
    approval_required: boolean
  } | null
  reference_file: string | null
  metadata: {
    contract_version: string
    backward_compatibility: string
  }
}
Error: ErrorSchema | null
```

#### Error Schema

```
Code: string                  # From Error Taxonomy (Section 11)
Message: string
Request_Type: string
Recoverable: boolean
```

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Tool selection is deterministic: needs_ui=true OR cluster_count>1 → ArgoCD; else → Flux.
- Sync policy mapping is fixed: production → manual; dev/staging → auto; cleanup → prune; drift → self-heal.
- Repository structure is fixed: apps/{env}/, infrastructure/, argocd/applications/.
- Secret strategy: null → sealed-secrets (default).
- Promotion: always staging → production with approval gate for production.
- OpenGitOps compliance: 4 principles (declarative, versioned, pulled, reconciled) — binary pass/fail.

#### What Agents May Assume

- Tool recommendation reflects current ArgoCD vs Flux capabilities.
- Sync policies are mutually compatible (can combine auto + prune + self-heal).
- Repo structure works for both ArgoCD and Flux.
- Production always requires manual sync (no auto-sync to production).

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- ArgoCD/Flux are installed.
- Kubernetes cluster exists.
- The skill creates files, resources, or configurations.
- Secret management is configured.

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| Tool select | None; decision output |
| Sync policy | None; recommendation |
| Repo structure | None; template output |
| Secret strategy | None; recommendation |
| Promotion | None; workflow output |
| Full guide | None; combined output |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Invocation Pattern

```
1. Define cluster count, team size, environments
2. Invoke tool-select for ArgoCD vs Flux decision
3. Invoke repo-structure for directory layout
4. Invoke sync-policy per environment
5. Invoke secret-strategy for secret management
6. Invoke promotion for multi-env workflow
7. Implement decisions (caller's responsibility)
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Each invocation produces a complete recommendation.
- No dependencies between request types (can invoke any individually).

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Invalid request type | Return error to caller | Use supported type |
| Missing cluster count | Return error to caller | Supply count |
| Missing environments | Return error to caller | Supply env list |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Zero internal retries. Deterministic output.

#### Isolation Model

- Each invocation is stateless and independent.

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Tool select | Yes | Same context = same tool |
| Sync policy | Yes | Same env = same policy |
| Repo structure | Yes | Fixed template |
| Secret strategy | Yes | Same input = same recommendation |
| Promotion | Yes | Same envs = same workflow |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 2-Phase Lifecycle

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Parse** | Validate request type, context fields | Validated input or error |
| **Evaluate** | Traverse decision tree for request type | Recommendation |

All phases synchronous. No async pipeline.

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fixed tool selection | needs_ui OR multi-cluster → ArgoCD; else → Flux |
| Fixed sync policies | 4 policies with fixed env mapping |
| Fixed repo structure | apps/{env}/, infrastructure/, argocd/applications/ |
| Fixed safety rules | No auto-sync production; no plaintext secrets; rollback tested |
| OpenGitOps compliance | 4 principles: declarative, versioned, pulled, reconciled |
| Production approval | Production promotion always requires explicit approval |
| No external calls | All decisions from embedded rules |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

Stateless. Fully idempotent. No persistent state.

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Unknown request type | Return `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Use supported type |
| Missing cluster count | Return `ERR_MISSING_CLUSTER_COUNT` | Supply count |
| Missing environments | Return `ERR_MISSING_ENVIRONMENTS` | Supply env list |
| Invalid environment name | Return `ERR_INVALID_ENVIRONMENT` | Use dev/staging/production |
| Reference file missing | Return `ERR_REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` | Verify installation |

**Invariant:** Every failure returns a structured error. No fallback to default recommendations.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Validation | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_MISSING_CLUSTER_COUNT` | Validation | Yes | Cluster count not provided |
| `ERR_MISSING_ENVIRONMENTS` | Validation | Yes | Environment list not provided |
| `ERR_INVALID_ENVIRONMENT` | Validation | Yes | Environment name not recognized |
| `ERR_REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` | Infrastructure | No | Reference file missing |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Decision timeout | N/A | N/A | Synchronous; < 50ms |
| Internal retries | Zero | Zero | Deterministic output |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema

### OpenTelemetry Observability (MANDATORY)

- **Decision Telemetry**: Every time the agent evaluates the tool selection (ArgoCD vs Flux) or sync policy, it MUST emit an OpenTelemetry Span (`gitops_decision_latency`) to measure the evaluation latency.
- **Policy Violation Alerts**: If the input context or user request attempts to assign an `Auto Sync` policy to the `Production` environment, the agent MUST immediately emit an OTel Event (`PRODUCTION_AUTO_SYNC_ATTEMPT`) with CRITICAL severity.

### Log Entry Format

```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "skill_name": "gitops-workflow",
  "contract_version": "2.0.0",
  "execution_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "request_type": "string",
  "cluster_count": "number",
  "tool_recommended": "string|null",
  "environments": "Array<string>|null",
  "sync_policy": "string|null",
  "status": "success|error",
  "error_code": "string|null",
  "duration_ms": "number"
}
```

### Required Log Points

| Event | Log Level | Fields |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Tool selected | INFO | tool_recommended, rationale |
| Sync policy selected | INFO | environment, policy |
| Auto-sync production blocked | WARN | environment |
| Decision failed | ERROR | error_code, message |

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Unit |
|--------|------|------|
| `gitops.decision.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `gitops.tool.distribution` | Counter | argocd vs flux |
| `gitops.sync_policy.distribution` | Counter | per policy |
| `gitops.environment.count` | Histogram | per invocation |

---

## 14. Security & Trust Model

### Data Handling

- GitOps Workflow does not access clusters, credentials, or kubeconfig.
- No secrets, tokens, or certificates are processed.
- Repo structure templates contain no sensitive data.

### Safety Rules (Enforced)

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| No auto-sync to production | Sync policy for production is always "manual" |
| No plaintext secrets in Git | Sealed Secrets or External Secrets recommended |
| Rollback procedure required | Included in promotion workflow |

---

## 15. Scalability Model

| Dimension | Constraint | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Throughput | CPU-bound decision tree | < 50ms; scales linearly |
| Concurrency | Stateless invocations | Unlimited parallel |
| Reference storage | 2 files (~6 KB) | Static; no growth |
| Memory per invocation | < 1 MB | No accumulation |
| Network | Zero network calls | No external dependency |

---

## 16. Concurrency Model

Fully parallel. No shared state. No coordination required.

---

## 17. Resource Lifecycle Management

All resources scoped to invocation. No persistent handles.

---

## 18. Performance Constraints

| Operation | P50 Target | P99 Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Tool selection | < 2 ms | < 5 ms | 20 ms |
| Full guide | < 10 ms | < 30 ms | 50 ms |
| Output size | ≤ 1,000 chars | ≤ 3,000 chars | 5,000 chars |

---

## 19. Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| ArgoCD/Flux feature changes | Medium | Stale comparison | Version-pinned comparison |
| Auto-sync to production | Low (blocked) | Unverified deployment | Manual sync enforced |
| Secrets in Git | Medium | Credential leakage | Sealed/External Secrets mandate |
| Cluster drift undetected | Low | State inconsistency | Reconciliation interval (3 min) |
| Promotion without approval | Low | Untested production | Approval gate mandatory |
