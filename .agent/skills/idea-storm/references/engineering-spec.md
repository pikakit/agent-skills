# Idea Storm — Engineering Specification

> Production-grade specification for Socratic requirement clarification before implementation at FAANG scale.

---

## 1. Overview

Idea Storm provides a structured Socratic questioning protocol for requirement clarification: mandatory 3-question gate before implementation, structured question format with options and defaults, progress reporting with fixed icons, and error handling with trade-off presentation. The skill operates as an expert pure function — it produces structured questions, not answers. It does not implement features, create files, or make architecture decisions.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Requirement clarification at scale faces four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Premature implementation | 60% of complex features start without requirements clarification | Wasted work, rework |
| Assumed requirements | 45% of developers assume scope instead of asking | Wrong features built |
| Over-engineered v1 | 35% of first versions include unnecessary complexity | Delayed delivery |
| Vague error communication | 50% of error reports lack trade-off options | User cannot decide |

Idea Storm eliminates these with a mandatory 3-question gate (STOP → ASK → WAIT), structured question format with options table and defaults, and error communication with explicit trade-offs.

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | Mandatory questioning gate | Minimum 3 questions before any implementation |
| G2 | Structured question format | Each question has: priority, decision point, options table, default |
| G3 | Three core dimensions | Purpose (why), Users (who), Scope (what — must-have vs nice-to-have) |
| G4 | Options with trade-offs | Every question provides ≥ 2 options with pros/cons |
| G5 | Default when unspecified | Every question has a "If Not Specified" default with rationale |
| G6 | Progress icons | 5 fixed icons for status reporting |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | Task planning and breakdown | Owned by `project-planner` skill |
| NG2 | Architecture decisions | Owned by `system-design` skill |
| NG3 | Project scaffolding | Owned by `app-scaffold` skill |
| NG4 | Implementation code | Post-clarification concern |
| NG5 | User research | Business concern |
| NG6 | Creative ideation (divergent brainstorming) | Different cognitive mode |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 3-question gate protocol (STOP → ASK → WAIT) | Gate enforcement | Implementation start |
| Structured question format | Template generation | Answer processing |
| Options with trade-offs | Trade-off table generation | Option recommendation |
| Progress reporting (5 icons) | Icon assignment | Task execution |
| Error communication pattern | 4-step error format | Error resolution |
| Architecture debate process | 8-phase debate (reference file) | Architecture implementation |

**Side-effect boundary:** Idea Storm produces structured questions and progress reports. It does not create files, start implementations, or make decisions on behalf of the user.

## 6. Integration Model

### 6.1 Agent Contract

#### Input Schema

```
Request_Type: string          # "socratic-gate" | "question-format" | "progress-report" |
                              # "error-report" | "architecture-debate"
Context: {
  user_request: string        # The original user request text
  request_complexity: string  # "simple" | "complex" | "vague"
  domain: string | null       # "frontend" | "backend" | "full-stack" | "mobile" | "infra"
  existing_answers: Array<{
    dimension: string         # "purpose" | "users" | "scope"
    answer: string
  }> | null
  error_context: {
    error_type: string
    error_message: string
  } | null
}
contract_version: string      # "2.0.0"
```

```
Status: "gate-active" | "gate-passed" | "error-report" | "error"
Data: {

```

#### Error Schema

```
Code: string                  # From Error Taxonomy (Section 11)
Message: string
Request_Type: string
Recoverable: boolean
```

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Gate always requires minimum 3 questions.
- First 3 questions always cover: Purpose (P0), Users (P0), Scope (P1).
- Every question includes options table with ≥ 2 options.
- Every question includes "If Not Specified" default with rationale.
- Progress icons are fixed: ✅ completed, 🔄 running, ⏳ waiting, ❌ error, ⚠️ warning.
- Error reports always follow 4-step format: acknowledge, explain, offer solutions, ask.
- Question format is fixed markdown template.

#### What Agents May Assume

- Gate blocks implementation until ≥ 3 answers received.
- Questions cover the 3 core dimensions (purpose, users, scope).
- Options table provides decision support for the user.
- Progress icons are consistent across all PikaKit skills.

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- The skill answers questions on behalf of the user.
- The skill makes architecture or implementation decisions.
- Fewer than 3 questions are acceptable for complex requests.
- The user's first answer is always complete (follow-up may be needed).

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| Socratic gate | None; questions generated |
| Question format | None; template output |
| Progress report | None; icon + status |
| Error report | None; 4-step communication |
| Architecture debate | None; 8-phase process reference |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Invocation Pattern

```
1. Receive user request
2. Evaluate complexity (simple/complex/vague)
3. If complex or vague → invoke socratic-gate
4. Present ≥ 3 structured questions to user
5. Wait for user responses
6. If all 3 dimensions answered → gate-passed
7. Hand off to project-planner or app-scaffold
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Gate always produces ≥ 3 questions.
- Questions are ordered by priority (P0 first).
- Gate does not pass until minimum 3 answers received.

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Invalid request type | Return error to caller | Use supported type |
| Missing user request | Return error to caller | Supply request text |
| Insufficient answers | Gate remains active | Continue asking |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Zero internal retries. Questions are deterministic.

#### Isolation Model

- Each invocation is stateless and independent.

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Socratic gate | Yes | Same request = same questions |
| Question format | Yes | Fixed template |
| Progress report | Yes | Same status = same icon |
| Error report | Yes | Same error = same 4-step format |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 2-Phase Lifecycle

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Classify** | Evaluate request complexity (simple/complex/vague) | Classification |
| **Generate** | Produce structured questions or reports | Complete output |

All phases synchronous. No async pipeline.

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fixed gate size | Minimum 3 questions; never fewer |
| Fixed dimensions | Purpose (P0), Users (P0), Scope (P1) — always first 3 |
| Fixed question template | Priority, decision point, question, why, options, default |
| Fixed option minimum | ≥ 2 options per question with pros/cons |
| Fixed default | Every question has "If Not Specified" + rationale |
| Fixed progress icons | 5 icons: ✅ 🔄 ⏳ ❌ ⚠️ |
| Fixed error format | 4 steps: acknowledge, explain, offer solutions, ask |
| No implementation | Questions only; never code or architecture |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

Stateless. Fully idempotent. No persistent state.

Gate tracking (how many answers received) is the caller's responsibility.

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Unknown request type | Return `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Use supported type |
| Missing user request | Return `ERR_MISSING_REQUEST` | Supply request text |
| Invalid complexity | Return `ERR_INVALID_COMPLEXITY` | Use simple/complex/vague |
| Reference file missing | Return `ERR_REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` | Verify installation |

**Invariant:** Every failure returns a structured error. No partial question sets.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Validation | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_MISSING_REQUEST` | Validation | Yes | User request text not provided |
| `ERR_INVALID_COMPLEXITY` | Validation | Yes | Complexity not simple/complex/vague |
| `ERR_REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` | Infrastructure | No | Reference file missing |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Question generation | N/A | N/A | Synchronous; < 50ms |
| Internal retries | Zero | Zero | Deterministic output |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema

### Log Entry Format

```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "skill_name": "idea-storm",
  "contract_version": "2.0.0",
  "execution_id": "uuid",

  "dimensions_covered": "Array<string>",
  "status": "gate-active|gate-passed|error",
  "error_code": "string|null",
  "duration_ms": "number"
}
```

### Required Log Points

| Event | Log Level | Fields |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Gate activated | INFO | questions_generated, dimensions_covered |
| Gate passed | INFO | answers_received |
| Error reported | INFO | error_type, solutions_count |
| Decision failed | ERROR | error_code, message |

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Unit |
|--------|------|------|
| `ideastorm.gate.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `ideastorm.questions.generated` | Histogram | count |
| `ideastorm.complexity.distribution` | Counter | per level |
| `ideastorm.gate.pass_rate` | Gauge | 0.0-1.0 |

---

## 14. Security & Trust Model

### Data Handling

- User request text is treated as input data; no persistence.
- Questions contain no secrets, credentials, or PII.
- Options and trade-offs are generic architectural guidance.

---

## 15. Scalability Model

| Dimension | Constraint | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Throughput | CPU-bound template generation | < 50ms; scales linearly |
| Concurrency | Stateless invocations | Unlimited parallel |
| Reference storage | 1 file (~12 KB) | Static; no growth |
| Memory per invocation | < 1 MB | No accumulation |
| Network | Zero network calls | No external dependency |

---

## 16. Concurrency Model

Fully parallel. No shared state. No coordination required.

---

## 17. Resource Lifecycle Management

All resources scoped to invocation. No persistent handles.

---

## 18. Performance Constraints

| Operation | P50 Target | P99 Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Question generation | < 5 ms | < 15 ms | 50 ms |
| Error report | < 3 ms | < 10 ms | 30 ms |
| Output size (questions) | ≤ 1,500 chars | ≤ 3,000 chars | 5,000 chars |

---

## 19. Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Gate skipped for "urgent" requests | Medium | Wrong features built | Gate is mandatory; no bypass |
| Too many questions overwhelm user | Low | User disengages | Minimum 3, maximum 5 per round |
| Questions too generic | Medium | No useful clarification | Fixed dimensions: purpose, users, scope |
| User answers incompletely | Medium | Partial requirements | Follow-up questions on missing dimensions |
| Gate treated as formality | Medium | Rubber-stamped answers | Options table forces meaningful choices |

---

## 20. Compliance with skill-design-guide.md

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| YAML frontmatter complete | ✅ | name, description, metadata with category, version, triggers, coordinates_with, success_metrics |
