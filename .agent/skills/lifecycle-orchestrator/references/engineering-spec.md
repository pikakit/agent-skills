# Lifecycle Orchestrator — Engineering Specification

> Production-grade specification for end-to-end task lifecycle management with state rollback at FAANG scale.

---

## 1. Overview

Lifecycle Orchestrator coordinates multi-phase task execution from input to completion with mandatory checkpoint/restore safety. It manages 7 pipeline phases (Input→Plan→Execute→Verify→Deploy→Learn→Complete), state persistence via checkpoint saves before risky operations, rollback on failure or user request, context token monitoring, and multi-agent handoff coordination. The skill operates as an **Orchestrator** — it manages pipeline state, invokes agents per phase, creates checkpoints, and restores state on rollback. It has side effects: file writes to `.agent/state/`, agent invocation, checkpoint management.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Multi-phase task orchestration at scale faces four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| No rollback capability | 40% of multi-file changes cannot be reverted | Permanent corruption |
| Phase ordering violations | 30% of complex tasks skip verification | Production defects |
| State loss on failure | 45% of interrupted tasks lose progress | Wasted work |
| Context token exhaustion | 25% of long tasks exceed context limits | Agent cannot continue |

Lifecycle Orchestrator eliminates these with mandatory checkpoints before every phase, phase ordering enforcement (Plan→Execute→Verify), 100% restore accuracy, and token monitoring at 70%/80% thresholds.

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | 7-phase pipeline | Input→Plan→Execute→Verify→Deploy→Learn→Complete |
| G2 | Checkpoint before risk | Save state before >3 file changes or risky refactoring |
| G3 | 100% restore accuracy | Rollback restores exact file state |
| G4 | State save < 1s | Checkpoint creation within 1 second |
| G5 | Context monitoring | Warning at 70%, mandatory action at 80% |
| G6 | Phase enforcement | Cannot skip verification |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | Task planning | Owned by `project-planner` skill |
| NG2 | Code execution | Owned by domain agents |
| NG3 | Error detection | Owned by `problem-checker` skill |
| NG4 | Agent routing | Owned by `smart-router` skill |
| NG5 | Progress reporting UI | Owned by `execution-reporter` skill |
| NG6 | Git-based versioning | Owned by `git-workflow` skill |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Pipeline phase management (7 phases) | Phase transitions + enforcement | Phase implementation |
| Checkpoint/restore (`.agent/state/`) | Save + restore + list | State storage infrastructure |
| Rollback on request | Restore latest checkpoint | Git revert |
| Context monitoring (70%/80% thresholds) | Token tracking + alerting | Context compression implementation |
| Agent handoff coordination | Phase-to-agent mapping | Agent execution |

**Side-effect boundary:** Lifecycle Orchestrator writes files to `.agent/state/`, invokes agents per phase, and restores file state on rollback. These side effects are non-idempotent.

---

## 6. Integration Model

### 6.1 Agent Contract

#### Input Schema

```
Request_Type: string          # "start" | "checkpoint" | "restore" | "rollback" |
                              # "advance" | "status" | "context-check"
Context: {
  task_id: string             # Unique task identifier
  current_phase: string | null  # Current pipeline phase
  files: Array<string> | null # Files to checkpoint
  checkpoint_id: string | null  # Specific checkpoint to restore
  token_usage_percent: number | null  # Current context usage
}
contract_version: string      # "2.0.0"
```

#### Output Schema

```
Status: "success" | "blocked" | "rollback" | "error"
Data: {
  pipeline: {
    current_phase: string     # Current phase name
    next_phase: string | null # Next phase (null if complete)
    phase_owner: string       # Agent/skill responsible
    phases_completed: Array<string>
    phases_remaining: Array<string>
  } | null
  checkpoint: {
    id: string                # Checkpoint identifier
    files: Array<string>      # Files saved
    timestamp: string         # ISO-8601
    phase: string             # Phase when saved
  } | null
  restore: {
    checkpoint_id: string
    files_restored: Array<string>
    restored_to_phase: string
  } | null
  context: {
    usage_percent: number     # Current usage
    threshold: string         # "normal" | "warning" | "critical"
    action: string            # "continue" | "compress" | "isolate"
  } | null
  metadata: {
    contract_version: string
    backward_compatibility: string
  }
}
Error: ErrorSchema | null
```

#### Error Schema

```
Code: string                  # From Error Taxonomy (Section 11)
Message: string
Request_Type: string
Recoverable: boolean
```

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Phase order is fixed: Input→Plan→Execute→Verify→Deploy→Learn→Complete.
- Cannot advance past Verify without 0 errors from `problem-checker`.
- Checkpoint is mandatory before: >3 file changes, risky refactoring, Deploy phase.
- Restore always uses the most recent checkpoint unless specific `checkpoint_id` given.
- Context thresholds are fixed: <70% = normal, 70-80% = warning, >80% = critical.
- Context actions are fixed: normal → continue, warning → compress, critical → isolate.

#### What Agents May Assume

- Pipeline phases execute in fixed order.
- Checkpoints are complete (all specified files saved).
- Restore produces exact file state at checkpoint time.
- Phase owners are deterministic per phase.

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- Phases are skippable.
- Rollback undoes git commits (only file state in `.agent/state/`).
- Context monitoring prevents token overflow (advisory only).
- Deploy phase is always reached (verification may block).

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| start | Creates task entry in pipeline state |
| checkpoint | Writes files to `.agent/state/{task_id}/` |
| restore | Overwrites project files from checkpoint |
| rollback | Restores latest checkpoint + resets phase |
| advance | Updates pipeline phase state |
| status | None; read-only query |
| context-check | None; read-only query |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Invocation Pattern

```
1. Invoke "start" with task_id
2. Invoke "checkpoint" before Plan phase
3. Invoke "advance" to Plan → delegate to project-planner
4. Invoke "checkpoint" before Execute phase
5. Invoke "advance" to Execute → delegate to domain agents
6. Invoke "checkpoint" before Verify phase
7. Invoke "advance" to Verify → delegate to problem-checker
8. If errors → invoke "rollback" or fix
9. Invoke "advance" to Deploy (if verified)
10. Invoke "advance" to Learn → Complete
```

#### State Transitions

```
IDLE → INPUT                [start invoked]
INPUT → PLANNING            [advance, task defined]
PLANNING → EXECUTING        [advance, PLAN.md approved]
EXECUTING → VERIFYING       [advance, code complete]
VERIFYING → EXECUTING       [errors found, rollback to execute]
VERIFYING → DEPLOYING       [advance, 0 errors]
DEPLOYING → LEARNING        [advance, deploy complete]
LEARNING → COMPLETED        [advance, lessons captured]  // terminal
VERIFYING → ROLLED_BACK     [rollback invoked]  // terminal — restart from checkpoint
EXECUTING → ROLLED_BACK     [rollback invoked]  // terminal — restart from checkpoint
ANY → FAILED                [unrecoverable error]  // terminal
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Checkpoint always created before advancing to Execute, Verify, Deploy.
- Restore always returns files to exact checkpoint state.
- Phase cannot advance without meeting phase exit criteria.

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Phase agent fails | Block advance | Retry phase or rollback |
| Checkpoint write fails | Block advance | Cannot proceed without checkpoint |
| Restore fails | Return error | Manual file recovery |
| Verification fails (errors > 0) | Block Deploy | Fix errors or rollback |
| Context critical (>80%) | Advisory | Compress or isolate context |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Phase retry: maximum 2 retries per phase.
- Checkpoint save: maximum 1 retry.
- Restore: zero retries (must succeed or fail).

#### Isolation Model

- Each task has independent pipeline state.
- Checkpoints scoped to task_id: `.agent/state/{task_id}/`.
- Concurrent tasks do not share checkpoints.

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| start | No | Creates new task state |
| checkpoint | No | New checkpoint each time |
| restore | No | Overwrites project files |
| rollback | No | Resets phase + restores files |
| advance | No | Changes pipeline phase |
| status | Yes | Read-only |
| context-check | Yes | Read-only |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 4-Phase Lifecycle per Pipeline Phase

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Checkpoint** | Save current state | Checkpoint ID |
| **Delegate** | Invoke phase owner agent | Phase result |
| **Validate** | Check phase exit criteria | Pass/fail |
| **Advance** | Move to next phase or block | Phase transition |

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Fixed phase order | Input→Plan→Execute→Verify→Deploy→Learn→Complete |
| Mandatory checkpoints | Before Execute, Verify, Deploy — never skipped |
| 100% restore accuracy | Byte-for-byte file restoration |
| Phase exit criteria | Plan: PLAN.md approved; Execute: code complete; Verify: 0 errors |
| Fixed context thresholds | 70% warning, 80% critical |
| Safety hierarchy | Safety > Recoverability > Correctness > Cleanliness > Convenience |
| No phase skipping | Verify cannot be bypassed to reach Deploy |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

Pipeline state. Not idempotent. State persisted in `.agent/state/{task_id}/`.

| State | Persistent | Scope |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Pipeline phase | Yes | Per task_id |
| Checkpoints (file snapshots) | Yes | Per task_id, per phase |
| Phase results | Yes | Per task_id |
| Context usage | No | Per invocation |

**Checkpoint structure:**

```
.agent/state/{task_id}/
├── checkpoint_{n}/
│   ├── manifest.json      # Files, timestamp, phase
│   └── files/             # Exact file copies
└── pipeline.json          # Current phase, history
```

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Phase agent failure | Return `ERR_PHASE_FAILED` | Retry (max 2) or rollback |
| Checkpoint write failure | Return `ERR_CHECKPOINT_FAILED` | Block advance; fix storage |
| Restore file not found | Return `ERR_RESTORE_FAILED` | Manual file recovery |
| Phase skip attempt | Return `ERR_PHASE_SKIP` | Follow phase order |
| Context critical | Return `WARN_CONTEXT_CRITICAL` | Compress or isolate |
| Invalid task_id | Return `ERR_INVALID_TASK` | Supply valid task_id |
| Deploy without verify | Return `ERR_VERIFY_REQUIRED` | Complete verification first |

**Invariant:** Every failure returns a structured error. No silent phase skipping.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `ERR_PHASE_FAILED` | Execution | Yes | Phase agent returned failure |
| `ERR_CHECKPOINT_FAILED` | Storage | Yes | Cannot write checkpoint |
| `ERR_RESTORE_FAILED` | Storage | No | Cannot restore from checkpoint |
| `ERR_PHASE_SKIP` | Validation | No | Attempted to skip a phase |
| `ERR_VERIFY_REQUIRED` | Validation | No | Deploy without passing verify |
| `ERR_INVALID_TASK` | Validation | Yes | Task ID not found |
| `WARN_CONTEXT_CRITICAL` | Advisory | Yes | Context usage > 80% |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Checkpoint save | 1,000 ms | 5,000 ms | File copy |
| Checkpoint restore | 2,000 ms | 10,000 ms | File overwrite |
| Phase execution | 300,000 ms (5 min) | 600,000 ms (10 min) | Agent execution |
| Phase retries | 2 | 2 | Fixed maximum |
| Checkpoint save retries | 1 | 1 | Storage is critical |
| Restore retries | 0 | 0 | Must succeed or fail |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema

### Log Entry Format

```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "skill_name": "lifecycle-orchestrator",
  "contract_version": "2.0.0",
  "execution_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "task_id": "string",

  "token_usage_percent": "number|null",
  "status": "success|blocked|rollback|error",
  "error_code": "string|null",
  "duration_ms": "number"
}
```

### Required Log Points

| Event | Log Level | Fields |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Pipeline started | INFO | task_id |
| Phase advanced | INFO | current_phase, next_phase |
| Checkpoint saved | INFO | checkpoint_id, files_count |
| Rollback triggered | WARN | checkpoint_id, restored_to_phase |
| Phase failed | ERROR | current_phase, error_code |
| Context warning | WARN | token_usage_percent |

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Unit |
|--------|------|------|
| `lifecycle.phase.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `lifecycle.checkpoint.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `lifecycle.rollback.count` | Counter | per task |
| `lifecycle.phase_retry.count` | Counter | per phase |
| `lifecycle.context.usage` | Gauge | percent |
| `lifecycle.pipeline.completion_rate` | Gauge | 0.0-1.0 |

---

## 14. Security & Trust Model

### Data Handling

- Checkpoints contain exact file copies; may include source code.
- Checkpoint storage (`.agent/state/`) is local filesystem; no remote transfer.
- Task IDs are internal identifiers; no PII.

### Access Control

| Operation | Authorization |
|-----------|--------------|
| Checkpoint save | Any orchestrating agent |
| Checkpoint restore | Any orchestrating agent |
| Checkpoint delete | Manual only (no auto-delete) |
| State directory access | Scoped to task_id |

---

## 15. Scalability Model

| Dimension | Constraint | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Throughput | I/O bound (file copy) | < 1s per checkpoint |
| Concurrent tasks | Independent pipelines | Scoped to task_id |
| Checkpoint storage | Grows with file count per task | Manual cleanup |
| Memory per task | File manifest + pipeline state | < 10 MB |
| Network | Zero network calls | Local filesystem only |

---

## 16. Concurrency Model

Single-thread per task. Concurrent tasks are independent.

| Dimension | Boundary |
|-----------|----------|
| Operations per task | 1 (sequential phases) |
| Concurrent tasks | Unlimited (independent state) |
| Checkpoint writes | Sequential within task |
| File restore | Exclusive write lock on target files |

---

## 17. Resource Lifecycle Management

| Resource | Created By | Destroyed By | Max Lifetime |
|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Pipeline state | start | Pipeline completion or manual | Per task |
| Checkpoint files | checkpoint | Manual cleanup | Permanent until deleted |
| Checkpoint manifest | checkpoint | Manual cleanup | Permanent until deleted |
| File restore lock | restore | Restore completion | Single invocation |

**Critical invariant:** Checkpoint files are never auto-deleted. Manual cleanup only.

---

## 18. Performance Constraints

| Operation | P50 Target | P99 Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Checkpoint save (≤10 files) | < 200 ms | < 500 ms | 1,000 ms |
| Checkpoint save (>10 files) | < 500 ms | < 2,000 ms | 5,000 ms |
| Restore | < 500 ms | < 3,000 ms | 10,000 ms |
| Phase advance | < 50 ms | < 200 ms | 500 ms |
| Status query | < 5 ms | < 20 ms | 50 ms |

---

## 19. Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Checkpoint storage exhaustion | Medium | Cannot save state | Manual cleanup protocol |
| Restore overwrites newer changes | Medium | Work loss | Checkpoint before restore |
| Phase agent timeout | Medium | Pipeline stalls | 5-min default, 10-min max |
| Skip verification attempt | Low (blocked) | Production defects | `ERR_VERIFY_REQUIRED` |
| Context overflow | Medium | Agent cannot continue | 70%/80% threshold alerts |
| Concurrent writes to same file | Low | Corruption | Exclusive write lock on restore |
