  Mobile-first design: touch interaction, platform conventions, offline behavior, and MFRI scoring.
  Use when designing mobile UI/UX, touch targets, or validating mobile design patterns.
  NOT for mobile code implementation (use mobile-developer) or web design (use design-system).

# Mobile Design — Mobile-First Design Doctrine

> Touch-first. Platform-respectful. MFRI scored. 44×44pt / 48×48dp minimum.

**Core Law:** Mobile is NOT a small desktop.

---

## When to Use

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Designing mobile UI | Score with MFRI |
| iOS vs Android | Check platform guidelines |
| Touch interactions | Use touch target standards |
| Accessibility audit | Check a11y requirements |

---

## System Boundaries

| Owned by This Skill | NOT Owned |
|---------------------|-----------|
| MFRI scoring (5 dimensions) | Mobile orchestration (→ mobile-first) |
| Platform guidelines (iOS/Android) | Mobile implementation (→ mobile-developer) |
| Touch target standards | Design system components (→ design-system) |
| Typography routing (SF Pro/Roboto) | API design (→ api-architect) |

**Expert decision skill:** Produces design decisions. Does not write code or create components.

---

## 5 Must-Ask Questions (Before Any Design)

| # | Question | Options |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | Platform? | iOS, Android, or both |
| 2 | Framework? | React Native, Flutter, native |
| 3 | Navigation? | Tabs, stack, drawer |
| 4 | Offline? | Must work offline? |
| 5 | Devices? | Phone only or tablet too |

---

## MFRI Scoring (Mobile Feasibility & Risk Index)

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Platform Clarity | Target platform defined? |
| Interaction Complexity | How complex are gestures? |
| Performance Risk | Heavy lists, animations, media? |
| Offline Dependence | Breaks without network? |
| Accessibility Risk | Motor, visual, cognitive impact? |

| Score | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 6-10 | ✅ Safe — proceed |
| 3-5 | ⚠️ Add validation |
| 0-2 | 🔴 Simplify first |
| < 0 | ❌ Redesign required |

---

## Platform Differences (Fixed)

| Element | iOS | Android |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Back | No button | System back |
| Navigation | Bottom tabs | Bottom nav / drawer |
| Typography | **SF Pro** | **Roboto** |
| Corner radius | Rounded (continuous) | Varies (MD3) |

---

## Touch Targets (Fixed)

| Standard | Minimum |
|----------|---------|
| **iOS** | 44×44 pt |
| **Android** | 48×48 dp |
| **Spacing** | 8dp between targets |

---

## Core Philosophy (Fixed Order)

```
Touch-first → Battery-conscious → Platform-respectful → Offline-capable
```

---

## Error Taxonomy

| Code | Recoverable | Trigger |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_PLATFORM` | Yes | Platform not ios/android/both |
| `ERR_MISSING_PLATFORM` | Yes | Platform not provided |
| `WARN_LOW_MFRI` | Yes | MFRI score below 3 |

**Zero internal retries.** Deterministic; same context = same assessment.

---

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|-------|
| Apply desktop patterns | Touch-first design |
| Use hover states | Tap and press states |
| Small tap targets | 44×44pt (iOS) / 48×48dp (Android) |
| Assume network | Design for offline |
| Mix platform conventions | Respect iOS HIG / Material Design |
