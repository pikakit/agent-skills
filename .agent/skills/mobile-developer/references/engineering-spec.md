# Mobile First — Engineering Specification

> Production-grade specification for mobile development orchestration at FAANG scale.

---

## 1. Overview

Mobile First is the orchestrator for mobile development. It routes requests to framework-specific sub-skills (React Native, Flutter, Native), publishing sub-skills (ASO, deep linking, push notifications), design references, and runtime audit scripts. The skill operates as an **Orchestrator** — it invokes sub-skills, coordinates framework selection routing, enforces 4 must-ask questions, and delegates implementation to `mobile-developer` and design to `mobile-design`. It produces routing decisions and delegates execution.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Mobile development orchestration at scale faces four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| No routing to correct sub-skill | 40% of mobile requests go to wrong specialist | Wrong patterns applied |
| Assumptions without asking | 55% of mobile tasks start without platform clarification | Rework |
| Framework content loaded unnecessarily | 30% of context consumed by irrelevant framework docs | Token waste |
| Publishing patterns not considered | 35% of apps built without ASO/push/deep-link planning | Post-launch scramble |

Mobile First eliminates these with deterministic sub-skill routing (3 framework + 3 publishing), mandatory 4 must-ask questions, selective content loading, and publishing-integrated planning.

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | Framework routing | 3 sub-skills: react-native.md, flutter.md, native.md |
| G2 | Publishing routing | 3 sub-skills: ASO, deep linking, push notifications |
| G3 | 4 must-ask questions | Platform, Framework, Navigation, Offline — mandatory |
| G4 | Framework decision tree | 5 branches: OTA → RN, custom UI → Flutter, iOS-deep → SwiftUI, Android-deep → Kotlin, existing → match |
| G5 | Selective loading | Read only relevant sub-skill; never all |
| G6 | Runtime audit | `mobile_audit.js` for UX/touch audit |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | Mobile implementation | Owned by `mobile-developer` skill |
| NG2 | Mobile design decisions | Owned by `mobile-design` skill |
| NG3 | Performance profiling | Owned by `perf-optimizer` skill |
| NG4 | Security code review | Owned by `mobile-security-coder` skill |
| NG5 | Framework-specific patterns | Delegated to framework sub-skills |
| NG6 | Design system | Owned by `design-system` skill |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Sub-skill routing (6 sub-skills) | Routing decision | Sub-skill content |
| Framework decision tree (5 branches) | Tree traversal | Framework installation |
| 4 must-ask questions | Question enforcement | Answer collection |
| Runtime audit script | Script invocation | Audit remediation |
| Pre-development checkpoint | Checkpoint template | Checkpoint validation |
| Design reference routing | File recommendation | Design implementation |

**Side-effect boundary:** Mobile First routes to sub-skills and invokes audit scripts. The audit script reads project files (read-only). No file creation, no code generation.

---

## 6. Integration Model

### 6.1 Agent Contract

#### Input Schema

```
Request_Type: string          # "route-framework" | "route-publishing" | "decision-tree" |
                              # "platform-defaults" | "audit" | "checkpoint"
Context: {
  platform: string | null     # "ios" | "android" | "both" | null (must ask)
  framework: string | null    # "react-native" | "flutter" | "swiftui" | "kotlin" | null
  navigation: string | null   # "tabs" | "drawer" | "stack" | null
  offline_required: boolean | null  # null means must ask
  project_path: string | null  # For audit script
}
contract_version: string      # "2.0.0"
```

#### Output Schema

```
Status: "success" | "error" | "needs-input"
Data: {
  routing: {
    sub_skill_path: string    # Relative path to sub-skill file
    sub_skill_type: string    # "framework" | "publishing" | "design"
    rationale: string
  } | null
  decision_tree: {
    selected_framework: string
    sub_skill_path: string
    decision_rationale: string
  } | null
  platform_defaults: {
    ios: object               # Font, touch target, back nav, icons
    android: object
  } | null
  audit: {
    script_path: string       # "scripts/mobile_audit.js"
    command: string           # Full command to run
    project_path: string
  } | null
  checkpoint: {
    template: string          # Pre-development checkpoint template
  } | null
  must_ask: Array<{
    aspect: string
    question: string
    reason: string
  }> | null
  metadata: {
    contract_version: string
    backward_compatibility: string
  }
}
Error: ErrorSchema | null
```

#### Error Schema

```
Code: string                  # From Error Taxonomy (Section 11)
Message: string
Request_Type: string
Recoverable: boolean
```

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Framework decision tree is fixed: OTA → RN+Expo, custom UI → Flutter, iOS-deep → SwiftUI, Android-deep → Kotlin+Compose, existing → match current.
- Sub-skill routing is fixed: framework name → specific file path.
- Publishing routing is fixed: ASO → app-store-optimization.md, deep linking → deep-linking.md, push → push-notifications.md.
- 4 must-ask questions are fixed: Platform, Framework, Navigation, Offline.
- Platform defaults are fixed: iOS (SF Pro, 44×44pt, edge swipe), Android (Roboto, 48×48dp, system back).

#### What Agents May Assume

- Sub-skill files exist at documented paths.
- Framework decision tree produces consistent routing.
- 4 must-ask questions are always the same.
- Audit script is read-only.

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- Platform has been determined (must ask first).
- Framework has been chosen (must route through decision tree).
- All sub-skills need loading (selective only).
- Audit script modifies files.

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| Route framework | None; path recommendation |
| Route publishing | None; path recommendation |
| Decision tree | None; framework selection |
| Platform defaults | None; reference data |
| Audit | Spawns python process, reads project files (read-only) |
| Checkpoint | None; template output |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Invocation Pattern

```
1. Invoke with empty context → returns must_ask questions
2. Collect answers from user (platform, framework, navigation, offline)
3. Invoke decision-tree with answers → returns framework + sub-skill path
4. Read the routed sub-skill file (caller's responsibility)
5. Optionally invoke route-publishing for ASO/push/deep-link
6. Optionally invoke audit with project_path
7. Invoke checkpoint for pre-development template
8. Proceed to implementation (→ mobile-developer)
```

#### State Transitions

```
IDLE → ASKING                [context incomplete]
ASKING → ROUTING             [4 questions answered]
ROUTING → ROUTED             [sub-skill path determined]  // terminal for routing
IDLE → AUDITING              [audit invoked with project_path]
AUDITING → AUDIT_COMPLETE    [script finished]  // terminal
AUDITING → AUDIT_FAILED      [script error]  // terminal
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Routing always produces a single sub-skill path.
- Audit script is read-only and does not modify project files.

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Missing platform | Return needs-input | Ask platform question |
| Unknown framework | Return error | Use decision tree |
| Sub-skill file missing | Return error | Verify installation |
| Audit script error | Return error | Check project path |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Routing: zero retries (deterministic).
- Audit: zero retries (script-level).

#### Isolation Model

- Each routing invocation is independent.
- Audit invocations are serial (one per project).

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Route framework | Yes | Same framework = same path |
| Route publishing | Yes | Same need = same path |
| Decision tree | Yes | Same context = same framework |
| Platform defaults | Yes | Fixed data |
| Audit | No | Reads current file state |
| Checkpoint | Yes | Fixed template |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 3-Phase Lifecycle

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Gather** | Enforce 4 must-ask questions | Context collected |
| **Route** | Traverse decision tree, select sub-skill | Sub-skill path |
| **Delegate** | Return path for caller to load | Routing complete |

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| 4 must-ask questions | Platform, Framework, Navigation, Offline — always |
| Fixed decision tree | 5 branches with explicit criteria |
| Fixed sub-skill paths | 3 framework + 3 publishing + 5+ design references |
| Selective loading | Read only routed sub-skill; never all files |
| Platform defaults fixed | iOS (SF Pro, 44pt, swipe), Android (Roboto, 48dp, back button) |
| Core principle | Mobile is NOT a small desktop |
| Philosophy order | Touch-first → Battery-conscious → Platform-respectful → Offline-capable |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

Orchestrator with routing state. Routing is idempotent (same context = same path). Audit is non-idempotent (reads current file state).

| State | Persistent | Scope |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Routing decision | No | Per invocation |
| Must-ask answers | No | Per invocation |
| Audit results | No | Per invocation |

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Incomplete context | Return `NEEDS_INPUT` with must-ask list | Answer questions |
| Unknown framework | Return `ERR_UNKNOWN_FRAMEWORK` | Use decision tree |
| Sub-skill file missing | Return `ERR_SUBSKILL_NOT_FOUND` | Verify installation |
| Audit project not found | Return `ERR_PROJECT_NOT_FOUND` | Supply correct path |
| Audit script failed | Return `ERR_AUDIT_FAILED` | Check Python installation |

**Invariant:** Every failure returns structured output. No partial routing.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `NEEDS_INPUT` | Context | Yes | Must-ask questions not answered |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_FRAMEWORK` | Routing | Yes | Framework not in decision tree |
| `ERR_SUBSKILL_NOT_FOUND` | Infrastructure | No | Sub-skill file missing |
| `ERR_PROJECT_NOT_FOUND` | Filesystem | Yes | Audit project path not found |
| `ERR_AUDIT_FAILED` | Execution | Yes | Audit script error |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Routing decision | N/A | N/A | Synchronous; < 50ms |
| Audit script | 30,000 ms | 120,000 ms | Project size dependent |
| Internal retries | Zero | Zero | Deterministic routing |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema

### Log Entry Format

```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "skill_name": "mobile-first",
  "contract_version": "2.0.0",
  "execution_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "request_type": "string",
  "platform": "string|null",
  "framework_selected": "string|null",
  "sub_skill_routed": "string|null",
  "must_ask_pending": "number",
  "status": "success|error|needs-input",
  "error_code": "string|null",
  "duration_ms": "number"
}
```

### Required Log Points

| Event | Log Level | Fields |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Framework routed | INFO | framework_selected, sub_skill_routed |
| Publishing routed | INFO | sub_skill_routed |
| Must-ask pending | INFO | must_ask_pending, missing_aspects |
| Audit started | INFO | project_path |
| Audit completed | INFO | project_path, duration_ms |
| Routing failed | ERROR | error_code, message |

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Unit |
|--------|------|------|
| `mobilefirst.routing.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `mobilefirst.framework.distribution` | Counter | per framework |
| `mobilefirst.must_ask.pending_rate` | Counter | per invocation |
| `mobilefirst.audit.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `mobilefirst.subskill.distribution` | Counter | per sub-skill |

---

## 14. Security & Trust Model

### Data Handling

- Mobile First does not process credentials, API keys, or PII.
- Audit script reads project files in read-only mode.
- No network calls from routing operations.

### Script Security

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| Audit script is read-only | No file modifications |
| Project path scoped | Only reads within supplied path |
| No external calls | Script is offline |

---

## 15. Scalability Model

| Dimension | Constraint | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Routing throughput | CPU-bound decision tree | < 50ms; scales linearly |
| Concurrent routing | Stateless per invocation | Unlimited parallel |
| Sub-skill file count | 6 sub-skills + 14 references | Static; no growth expected |
| Audit concurrency | One per project | Serial per project |
| Memory | < 1 MB per routing | No accumulation |

---

## 16. Concurrency Model

Routing is fully parallel (stateless). Audit is serial per project.

| Dimension | Boundary |
|-----------|----------|
| Routing invocations | Unlimited parallel |
| Audit per project | Serial (exclusive) |
| Sub-skill reads | Parallel (no writes) |

---

## 17. Resource Lifecycle Management

| Resource | Created By | Destroyed By | Max Lifetime |
|----------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Routing decision | Invocation | Invocation end | Per invocation |
| Audit process | Audit invocation | Script completion | 120,000 ms max |
| Must-ask state | Invocation | Invocation end | Per invocation |

---

## 18. Performance Constraints

| Operation | P50 Target | P99 Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Framework routing | < 2 ms | < 5 ms | 20 ms |
| Decision tree traversal | < 3 ms | < 10 ms | 30 ms |
| Audit execution | < 10,000 ms | < 60,000 ms | 120,000 ms |
| Output size | ≤ 1,000 chars | ≤ 3,000 chars | 5,000 chars |

---

## 19. Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Sub-skill file moved | Low | Route broken | Fixed paths |
| Audit script Python missing | Medium | Audit unavailable | Notify user |
| Wrong framework assumed | High | Wrong patterns | 4 must-ask enforced |
| All sub-skills loaded | Medium | Context waste | Selective loading enforced |
| Decision tree outdated | Low | Missing new frameworks | Review annually |
