# Performance Profiler — Engineering Specification

> Production-grade specification for performance profiling and Core Web Vitals at FAANG scale.

---

## 1. Overview

Performance Profiler provides structured performance analysis: Core Web Vitals targeting (LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1), profiling tool selection (5 tools), 4-step profiling workflow (Baseline → Identify → Fix → Validate), bundle analysis (4 issues, 4 actions), runtime profiling (4 task patterns, 3 memory patterns), bottleneck diagnosis (4 symptom→cause mappings), and prioritized quick wins (5 ranked). The skill operates as an **Expert (decision tree)** — it produces profiling methodologies, tool recommendations, and fix strategies. It does not execute profiling tools, modify code, or run Lighthouse.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Performance work at scale faces four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| No baseline measurement | 55% of performance fixes lack before/after data | Unknown improvement |
| Wrong profiling tool | 40% of developers use Lighthouse for runtime issues | Misdiagnosis |
| Guessing at bottlenecks | 50% of changes target non-critical paths | Wasted effort |
| Missing Core Web Vitals | 35% of sites exceed LCP 4.0s threshold | Poor user experience, SEO penalty |

Performance Profiler eliminates these with mandatory baseline measurement, deterministic tool selection (symptom → tool), bottleneck diagnosis (symptom → cause), and fixed Core Web Vitals targets.

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | Core Web Vitals targets | LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1 |
| G2 | 4-step profiling workflow | Baseline → Identify → Fix → Validate |
| G3 | Tool selection | 5 tools mapped to 5 problem types |
| G4 | Bundle analysis | 4 issues with 4 fix actions |
| G5 | Runtime profiling | 4 task patterns + 3 memory patterns |
| G6 | Quick wins ranked | 5 priorities ordered by impact |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | Running Lighthouse | Guidance only; execution is caller's responsibility |
| NG2 | Code modification | Owned by executing agents |
| NG3 | E2E testing | Owned by `e2e-automation` skill |
| NG4 | Browser automation | Owned by Lighthouse script in `scripts/` |
| NG5 | Backend profiling implementation | Guidance in `backend-patterns.md`; execution external |
| NG6 | CDN configuration | Infrastructure concern |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Core Web Vitals targets | Threshold definitions | Measurement execution |
| Profiling tool selection | Tool → problem mapping | Tool installation |
| Bundle analysis guidance | Issue identification + fix actions | Bundle build |
| Runtime profiling guidance | Pattern recognition | DevTools execution |
| Quick win prioritization | Ranked actions | Implementation |
| Backend profiling patterns | N+1 query detection guidance | Query execution |

**Side-effect boundary:** Performance Profiler produces methodologies, tool recommendations, and fix strategies. It does not run profiling tools, modify code, or access production systems.

---

## 6. Integration Model

### 6.1 Agent Contract

#### Input Schema

```
Request_Type: string          # "core-web-vitals" | "profiling-workflow" | "tool-select" |

```

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Core Web Vitals targets are fixed: LCP < 2.5s, INP < 200ms, CLS < 0.1.
- Profiling workflow is fixed: 4 steps in defined order.
- Tool selection is deterministic: symptom → tool mapping.
- Bundle issues/actions are fixed: 4 issues, 4 actions.
- Quick wins are fixed: 5 priorities in ranked order.
- Same symptom = same tool recommendation.

#### What Agents May Assume

- Core Web Vitals thresholds match Google's published standards.
- Profiling tools are available in standard browser DevTools.
- Bundle analyzer is npm-installable.
- Lighthouse is available via CLI or browser.

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- Profiling tools are pre-installed.
- Current metrics are available (may be null).
- Framework-specific patterns always apply.
- Quick wins are sufficient (may need deeper analysis).

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| Core Web Vitals | None; threshold output |
| Tool selection | None; recommendation |
| Bundle analysis | None; issue guidance |
| Runtime profiling | None; pattern guidance |
| Quick wins | None; prioritized list |
| Backend patterns | None; guidance output |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Invocation Pattern

```
1. Identify performance symptom (slow load, jank, memory, bundle)
2. Invoke tool-select for appropriate profiling tool
3. Invoke profiling-workflow for 4-step process
4. Run profiling tool (caller's responsibility)
5. Invoke bottleneck-diagnosis with results
6. Invoke quick-wins for prioritized fix actions
7. Apply fixes (caller's responsibility)
8. Re-invoke profiling-workflow for validation
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Each invocation produces a complete recommendation.
- All decisions are independent (can be invoked in any order).

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Unknown symptom | Return error | Describe symptom more specifically |
| Unknown framework | Return error | Specify supported framework |
| Invalid request type | Return error | Use supported type |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Zero internal retries. Deterministic output.

#### Isolation Model

- Each invocation is stateless and independent.

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Core Web Vitals | Yes | Fixed thresholds |
| Tool selection | Yes | Same symptom = same tool |
| Quick wins | Yes | Fixed ranking |
| Bundle analysis | Yes | Fixed issues/actions |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 2-Phase Lifecycle

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Classify** | Map symptom to profiling domain | Classification |
| **Guide** | Generate tool recommendation, workflow, or fix strategy | Complete output |

All phases synchronous. No async pipeline.

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Core Web Vitals fixed | LCP < 2.5s (good), > 4.0s (poor); INP < 200ms (good), > 500ms (poor); CLS < 0.1 (good), > 0.25 (poor) |
| 4-step workflow fixed | Baseline → Identify → Fix → Validate |
| Tool selection deterministic | Page load → Lighthouse; Bundle → Analyzer; Runtime → DevTools Perf; Memory → DevTools Memory; Network → DevTools Network |
| Bundle issues fixed | Large deps → import specific; Duplicates → dedupe; Unused → tree-shake; Missing splits → code split |
| Quick wins ranked | 1: Compression, 2: Lazy images, 3: Code split, 4: Cache static, 5: Image formats |
| Long task threshold | > 50ms = UI blocking |
| Measure before fixing | Baseline mandatory; no guessing |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

Stateless. Fully idempotent. No persistent state.

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Unknown symptom | Return `ERR_UNKNOWN_SYMPTOM` | Describe symptom |
| Unknown framework | Return `ERR_UNKNOWN_FRAMEWORK` | Specify framework |
| Invalid request type | Return `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Use supported type |

**Invariant:** Every failure returns a structured error. No partial guidance.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Validation | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_SYMPTOM` | Validation | Yes | Symptom not in known set |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_FRAMEWORK` | Validation | Yes | Framework not recognized |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Decision generation | N/A | N/A | Synchronous; < 50ms |
| Internal retries | Zero | Zero | Deterministic output |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema

### Log Entry Format

```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "skill_name": "perf-optimizer",
  "contract_version": "2.0.0",
  "execution_id": "uuid",

  "framework": "string|null",
  "tool_recommended": "string|null",
  "status": "success|error",
  "error_code": "string|null",
  "duration_ms": "number"
}
```

### Required Log Points

| Event | Log Level | Fields |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Tool recommended | INFO | symptom, tool_recommended |
| Vitals assessed | INFO | current_lcp, current_inp, current_cls |
| Quick wins generated | INFO | priority_count |
| Decision failed | ERROR | error_code, message |

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Unit |
|--------|------|------|
| `perfoptimizer.decision.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `perfoptimizer.symptom.distribution` | Counter | per symptom type |
| `perfoptimizer.tool.distribution` | Counter | per recommended tool |
| `perfoptimizer.framework.distribution` | Counter | per framework |

---

## 14. Security & Trust Model

### Data Handling

- Performance Profiler processes no credentials, API keys, or PII.
- Current metric values (LCP, INP, CLS) are numeric only.
- No network calls, no file access, no system profiling.

---

## 15. Scalability Model

| Dimension | Constraint | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Throughput | CPU-bound decision tree | < 50ms; scales linearly |
| Concurrency | Stateless invocations | Unlimited parallel |
| Memory per invocation | < 1 MB | No accumulation |
| Network | Zero network calls | No external dependency |

---

## 16. Concurrency Model

Fully parallel. No shared state. No coordination required.

---

## 17. Resource Lifecycle Management

All resources scoped to invocation. No persistent handles.

---

## 18. Performance Constraints

| Operation | P50 Target | P99 Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Tool selection | < 2 ms | < 5 ms | 20 ms |
| Vitals assessment | < 2 ms | < 5 ms | 20 ms |
| Full guide | < 10 ms | < 30 ms | 50 ms |
| Output size | ≤ 2,000 chars | ≤ 5,000 chars | 8,000 chars |

---

## 19. Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Core Web Vitals thresholds change | Low | Outdated targets | Track Google updates |
| New profiling tools emerge | Low | Missing recommendations | Annual review |
| Framework-specific patterns change | Medium | Stale guidance | Track framework releases |
| Bundle analyzer API changes | Low | Script breakage | Pin analyzer version |
