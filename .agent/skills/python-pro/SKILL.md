# Python Pro — Framework Selection & Architecture

> Decision-making principles. Not patterns to copy. Ask, classify, decide.

---

## When to Use

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Choosing Python framework | Use decision tree |
| API-first / microservices | Consider FastAPI |
| Full-stack web / CMS | Consider Django |
| Async vs sync decision | Check I/O vs CPU classification |

---

## System Boundaries

| Owned by This Skill | NOT Owned |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Framework selection (5 branches) | API design (→ api-architect) |
| Async/sync classification | Testing strategy (→ test-architect) |
| Type hint rules | Database schema (→ data-modeler) |
| Architecture layering | Code implementation |

**Expert decision skill:** Produces recommendations. Does not write code.

---

## Framework Decision Tree (Deterministic)

```
What are you building?
│
├── API-first / Microservices  → FastAPI
├── Full-stack web / CMS       → Django
├── Simple / Script / Learning → Flask
├── AI/ML API serving          → FastAPI
└── Background workers         → Celery + any
```

**If user has explicit preference → respect it.** Ask when unclear.

---

## Async vs Sync (Deterministic)

| Workload | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| I/O-bound (HTTP, DB, file) | `async` | Waiting for external |
| CPU-bound (compute) | `sync` + multiprocessing | Number crunching |
| Mixed | Async with sync offload | `run_in_executor` |

**Constraints:** Never use sync libraries in async code. Never force async for CPU work.

---

## Architecture Layering (Fixed)

```
Routes (HTTP handlers)
  └→ Services (business logic)
      └→ Repositories (data access)
```

**Rule:** No business logic in routes/views. Routes delegate to services.

---

## Type Hints & Validation (Mandatory)

| Rule | Scope |
|------|-------|
| Type hints on all public APIs | Functions, methods, return types |
| Pydantic for validation | All input/output boundaries |
| No `Any` in public signatures | Use specific types or generics |

---

## Decision Checklist

- [ ] Asked user about framework preference?
- [ ] Chosen framework for THIS context?
- [ ] Decided async vs sync?
- [ ] Planned type hint strategy?
- [ ] Defined project structure?
- [ ] Considered background tasks (Celery)?

---

## Error Taxonomy

| Code | Recoverable | Trigger |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_PROJECT_TYPE` | Yes | Project type not one of 5 |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_FRAMEWORK` | Yes | Framework not fastapi/django/flask |

**Zero internal retries.** Same context = same recommendation.

---

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|-------|
| Default to Django for simple APIs | Choose framework per context |
| Use sync libraries in async code | Use async-compatible libraries |
| Skip type hints on public APIs | Annotate all public functions |
| Put business logic in routes/views | Separate: routes → services → repos |
| Always pick the same framework | Ask user, evaluate context |
