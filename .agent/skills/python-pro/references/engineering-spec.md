# Python Pro — Engineering Specification

> Production-grade specification for Python development principles at FAANG scale.

---

## 1. Overview

Python Pro provides structured decision frameworks for Python development: framework selection (FastAPI, Django, Flask), async vs sync routing (I/O-bound → async, CPU-bound → sync + multiprocessing), type hint strategy, project structure, and architecture patterns (routes → services → repos). The skill operates as an **Expert (decision tree)** — it produces framework recommendations, architecture decisions, and pattern guidance. It does not write code, install packages, or execute Python scripts.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Python project decisions at scale face four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Wrong framework for context | 40% of projects use Django for simple APIs | Over-engineering, slow starts |
| Sync in async contexts | 35% of async projects use sync libraries | Blocked event loop, poor throughput |
| Missing type hints | 50% of public APIs lack type annotations | Runtime errors, poor DX |
| Business logic in routes | 45% of projects embed logic in views/routes | Untestable, tightly coupled |

Python Pro eliminates these with deterministic framework routing (5-branch decision tree), async/sync classification (I/O vs CPU), mandatory type hint rules, and layered architecture (routes → services → repos).

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | Framework selection | 5-branch decision tree: API→FastAPI, Web→Django, Simple→Flask, AI/ML→FastAPI, Workers→Celery |
| G2 | Async/sync routing | I/O-bound → async; CPU-bound → sync + multiprocessing |
| G3 | Type hint coverage | All public APIs, Pydantic models, function signatures |
| G4 | Project structure | Layered: routes → services → repositories |
| G5 | Validation | Pydantic for all input/output boundaries |
| G6 | Reference collection | 7 reference files for deep-dive patterns |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | API design patterns | Owned by `api-architect` skill |
| NG2 | Testing strategy | Owned by `test-architect` skill |
| NG3 | Database schema | Owned by `data-modeler` skill |
| NG4 | Code implementation | Guidance only; execution is caller's responsibility |
| NG5 | Package management (pip/poetry) | Tooling decision outside core scope |
| NG6 | DevOps/deployment | Owned by deployment skills |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Framework selection | Decision criteria | Framework installation |
| Async/sync routing | Classification | Async runtime configuration |
| Type hint guidance | Rules and patterns | Type checker execution |
| Project structure | Layout recommendations | File/directory creation |
| Architecture patterns | Layering rules | Code generation |
| Validation patterns | Pydantic guidance | Model creation |

**Side-effect boundary:** Python Pro produces decisions, recommendations, and architecture guidance. It does not create files, run commands, or modify code.

## 6. Integration Model

### 6.1 Agent Contract

#### Input Schema

```
Request_Type: string          # "framework-select" | "async-sync" | "type-hints" |
                              # "project-structure" | "architecture" | "validation" |
                              # "full-guide"
Context: {
  project_type: string        # "api" | "web" | "script" | "ai-ml" | "workers"
  scale: string | null        # "small" | "medium" | "large"
  async_needs: string | null  # "io-bound" | "cpu-bound" | "mixed" | null
  framework_preference: string | null  # "fastapi" | "django" | "flask" | null
  has_background_tasks: boolean
}
contract_version: string      # "2.0.0"
```

#### Output Schema

```
Status: "success" | "error"
Data: {
  framework: {
    recommended: string       # "fastapi" | "django" | "flask"
    rationale: string
    with_celery: boolean      # Background task recommendation
  } | null
  async_decision: {
    mode: string              # "async" | "sync" | "mixed"
    rationale: string
    warnings: Array<string>   # e.g., "Do not use sync DB drivers in async"
  } | null
  structure: {
    layout: string            # "flat" | "layered" | "domain-driven"
    layers: Array<string>     # ["routes", "services", "repositories"]
  } | null

    coverage: string          # "all-public" | "full"
    validation: string        # "pydantic"
  } | null
  reference_files: Array<string> | null  # Relevant reference file paths
  metadata: {
    contract_version: string
    backward_compatibility: string
  }
}

```

#### Error Schema

```
Code: string                  # From Error Taxonomy (Section 11)
Message: string

```

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Framework selection is deterministic: project_type → framework.
- Async/sync classification is deterministic: I/O-bound → async; CPU-bound → sync.
- Type hint rules are fixed: all public APIs use type annotations.
- Architecture layers are fixed: routes → services → repositories.
- Validation is fixed: Pydantic for all boundaries.
- Same project context = same recommendations.

#### What Agents May Assume

- Framework decision tree follows documented branches.
- Async recommendation follows I/O vs CPU classification.
- Reference files exist at documented paths.
- Layered architecture applies to all non-script projects.

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- User has framework preference (ask if unclear).
- Project is always async (check requirements).
- Django is always the right choice for web (check complexity).
- All frameworks support the same patterns.

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| Framework selection | None; recommendation |
| Async/sync routing | None; classification |
| Type hints | None; rules output |
| Project structure | None; layout recommendation |
| Architecture | None; pattern guidance |
| Full guide | None; combined output |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Invocation Pattern

```
1. Identify project type (api/web/script/ai-ml/workers)
2. Ask user for framework preference if unclear
3. Invoke framework-select for recommendation
4. Invoke async-sync for concurrency classification
5. Invoke project-structure for layout
6. Load relevant reference files for deep patterns
7. Implement (caller's responsibility)
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Each invocation produces a complete recommendation.
- All decisions are independent (can be invoked in any order).
- User preference overrides decision tree when provided.

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Unknown project type | Return error | Specify valid type |
| Unknown framework | Return error | Use fastapi, django, or flask |
| Invalid request type | Return error | Use supported type |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Zero internal retries. Deterministic output.

#### Isolation Model

- Each invocation is stateless and independent.

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Framework selection | Yes | Same project type = same framework |
| Async/sync | Yes | Same needs = same mode |
| Project structure | Yes | Same context = same layout |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 2-Phase Lifecycle

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Classify** | Parse project type, scale, async needs | Classification |
| **Guide** | Generate framework recommendation, patterns, structure | Complete output |

All phases synchronous. No async pipeline.

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Framework routing | API/microservices → FastAPI; Full-stack/CMS/admin → Django; Simple/scripts → Flask; AI/ML serving → FastAPI; Background workers → Celery + any |
| Async classification | I/O-bound (HTTP, DB, file) → async; CPU-bound (compute) → sync + multiprocessing |
| Async constraints | Never mix sync libraries in async code; never force async for CPU work |
| Type hints mandatory | All public APIs, all function signatures, all Pydantic models |
| Validation | Pydantic at all boundaries (input/output) |
| Architecture layering | Routes (HTTP) → Services (business logic) → Repositories (data access) |
| No logic in routes | Routes delegate to services; services contain business logic |
| User preference respected | Explicit preference overrides decision tree |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

Stateless. Fully idempotent. No persistent state.

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Unknown project type | Return `ERR_UNKNOWN_PROJECT_TYPE` | Specify api, web, script, ai-ml, or workers |
| Unknown framework | Return `ERR_UNKNOWN_FRAMEWORK` | Specify fastapi, django, or flask |
| Invalid request type | Return `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Use supported type |

**Invariant:** Every failure returns a structured error. No partial guidance.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Validation | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_PROJECT_TYPE` | Validation | Yes | Project type not one of 5 |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_FRAMEWORK` | Validation | Yes | Framework not fastapi, django, or flask |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Decision generation | N/A | N/A | Synchronous; < 50ms |
| Internal retries | Zero | Zero | Deterministic output |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema

### Log Entry Format

```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "skill_name": "python-pro",
  "contract_version": "2.0.0",
  "execution_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "request_type": "string",
  "project_type": "string",
  "framework_recommended": "string|null",
  "async_mode": "string|null",
  "status": "success|error",
  "error_code": "string|null",
  "duration_ms": "number"
}
```

### Required Log Points

| Event | Log Level | Fields |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Framework selected | INFO | project_type, framework_recommended |
| Async mode decided | INFO | async_needs, async_mode |
| Structure recommended | INFO | layout, layers |
| Decision failed | ERROR | error_code, message |

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Unit |
|--------|------|------|
| `pythonpro.decision.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `pythonpro.framework.distribution` | Counter | fastapi vs django vs flask |
| `pythonpro.async_mode.distribution` | Counter | async vs sync vs mixed |
| `pythonpro.project_type.distribution` | Counter | per project type |

---

## 14. Security & Trust Model

### Data Handling

- Python Pro processes no credentials, API keys, or PII.
- Framework recommendations contain no sensitive data.
- No network calls, no file access, no code execution.

---

## 15. Scalability Model

| Dimension | Constraint | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Throughput | CPU-bound decision tree | < 50ms; scales linearly |
| Concurrency | Stateless invocations | Unlimited parallel |
| Reference files | 7 files (static) | No growth expected |
| Memory per invocation | < 1 MB | No accumulation |
| Network | Zero network calls | No external dependency |

---

## 16. Concurrency Model

Fully parallel. No shared state. No coordination required.

---

## 17. Resource Lifecycle Management

All resources scoped to invocation. No persistent handles.

---

## 18. Performance Constraints

| Operation | P50 Target | P99 Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Framework selection | < 2 ms | < 5 ms | 20 ms |
| Async/sync routing | < 2 ms | < 5 ms | 20 ms |
| Full guide | < 10 ms | < 30 ms | 50 ms |
| Output size | ≤ 2,000 chars | ≤ 5,000 chars | 8,000 chars |

---

## 19. Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| New Python framework emerges | Low | Missing recommendation | Annual review |
| FastAPI/Django breaking changes | Medium | Outdated patterns | Track release notes |
| Async ecosystem changes | Low | Stale async guidance | Monitor PEP updates |
| Pydantic v3 | Low | Validation pattern changes | Track major releases |
