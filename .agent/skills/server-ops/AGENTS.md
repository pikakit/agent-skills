# Server Ops — Production Server Management

> Boring servers = well-managed servers. Auto-restart. Monitor day one. Rotate logs.

---

## When to Use

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Deploy Node.js app | Use PM2 |
| Server provisioning | Check platform selection |
| High CPU/memory | Follow scaling decisions |
| Server issues | Use 5-step troubleshooting |

---

## System Boundaries

| Owned by This Skill | NOT Owned |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Process manager selection (4 tools) | CI/CD pipelines (→ cicd-pipeline) |
| Monitoring strategy (4 categories) | Observability instrumentation (→ observability) |
| Scaling decisions (3 strategies) | Security scanning (→ security-scanner) |
| Health check design | Command execution |

**Expert decision skill:** Produces management recommendations. Does not execute commands.

---

## Process Manager Selection (Deterministic)

| Scenario | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Node.js app | PM2 (clustering, reload) |
| Any app (Linux) | systemd (native) |
| Containers | Docker / Podman |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes / Swarm |

**4 Goals:** restart-on-crash, zero-downtime reload, clustering, persist across reboot.

---

## Monitoring Strategy (4 Categories × 3 Levels)

| Category | Key Metrics |
|----------|------------|
| Availability | Uptime, health checks |
| Performance | Response time, throughput |
| Errors | Error rate, types |
| Resources | CPU, memory, disk |

| Alert Level | Response |
|-------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Immediate action |
| **Warning** | Investigate soon |
| **Info** | Review daily |

---

## Log Management (3 Types + 4 Principles)

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Application | Debug, audit trail |
| Access | Traffic analysis |
| Error | Issue detection |

**Principles:** Rotate logs, structured JSON, appropriate levels, no sensitive data.

---

## Scaling Decisions (Deterministic)

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| High CPU | Add instances (horizontal) |
| High memory | Increase RAM or fix leak (vertical) |
| Slow response | Profile first, then scale |
| Traffic spikes | Auto-scaling |

| Strategy | When |
|----------|------|
| Vertical | Quick fix, single instance |
| Horizontal | Sustainable, distributed |
| Auto | Variable traffic |

---

## Health Checks (2 Levels)

| Level | Design |
|-------|--------|
| **Simple** | HTTP 200 response |
| **Deep** | Check DB, dependencies, resources |

Route by load balancer needs.

---

## 5-Step Troubleshooting (Fixed Priority)

1. **Process status** — Is it running?
2. **Logs** — Error messages?
3. **Resources** — Disk, memory, CPU?
4. **Network** — Ports, DNS?
5. **Dependencies** — Database, APIs?

---

## Error Taxonomy

| Code | Recoverable | Trigger |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_RUNTIME` | Yes | Runtime not one of 4 |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_ENVIRONMENT` | Yes | Environment not one of 4 |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_SYMPTOM` | Yes | Scaling symptom not recognized |

**Zero internal retries.** Same context = same recommendation.

---

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|-------|
| Run as root | Use non-root user |
| Ignore logs | Set up log rotation |
| Skip monitoring | Monitor from day one |
| Manual restarts | Auto-restart configuration |
| No backups | Regular backup schedule |

## Detailed Rules


---

### Rule: engineering-spec

---
name: server-ops
version: "2.0.0"
description: >-
  Production-grade specification for server management at FAANG scale.
metadata:
  category: "server-management"
  triggers: "server management, process management, monitoring, logging, scaling, health checks, security, troubleshooting"
  success_metrics: "process management, monitoring, logging, scaling, health checks, security, troubleshooting"
  coordinates_with: "cicd-pipeline, observability, security-scanner"
---

## 1. Overview

Server Ops provides structured decision frameworks for production server management: process management tool selection (4 tools), monitoring strategy (4 categories, 3 alert levels), log management (3 types, 4 principles), scaling decisions (4 symptoms → solutions, 3 strategies), health checks (4 checks, 2 levels), security principles (5 areas), and troubleshooting priority (5-step). The skill operates as an **Expert (decision tree)** — it produces server management recommendations, tool selections, and scaling strategies. It does not execute commands, configure servers, or install tools.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Server management at scale faces four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Wrong process manager | 40% of projects use raw `node` in production | No auto-restart, no clustering |
| Missing monitoring | 50% of servers lack health checks | Undetected outages |
| Manual scaling | 35% of scaling is reactive | Downtime during traffic spikes |
| Log mismanagement | 45% of servers have no log rotation | Disk exhaustion |

Server Ops eliminates these with deterministic tool selection (4 tools by scenario), monitoring-from-day-one principle, 3 scaling strategies, and 4 log management principles.

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | Process management | 4 tools by scenario (PM2, systemd, Docker, K8s) |
| G2 | Monitoring | 4 categories × 3 alert levels × 4 tool options |
| G3 | Log management | 3 types + 4 principles |
| G4 | Scaling decisions | 4 symptoms → 4 solutions + 3 strategies |
| G5 | Health checks | 4 checks + 2 levels (simple, deep) |
| G6 | Security | 5 areas with defined principles |
| G7 | Troubleshooting | 5-step priority order |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | CI/CD pipeline configuration | Owned by `cicd-pipeline` skill |
| NG2 | Observability instrumentation | Owned by `observability` skill |
| NG3 | Security vulnerability scanning | Owned by `security-scanner` skill |
| NG4 | Command execution | Guidance only; execution is caller's responsibility |
| NG5 | Cloud provider specifics | Platform-agnostic |
| NG6 | Application-level profiling | Owned by `perf-optimizer` skill |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Process manager selection | Tool routing (4 scenarios) | Tool installation |
| Monitoring strategy | Category + alert design | Dashboard configuration |
| Log management | Principles + type routing | Log aggregation setup |
| Scaling decisions | Symptom → solution mapping | Infrastructure provisioning |
| Health checks | Check design + level routing | Endpoint implementation |
| Security principles | 5 area guidelines | Firewall configuration |

**Side-effect boundary:** Server Ops produces management recommendations, tool selections, and scaling strategies. It does not execute commands, modify server state, or access infrastructure.

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Process manager selection is deterministic: Node.js → PM2; generic → systemd; containerized → Docker; orchestrated → Kubernetes.
- Scaling strategy is deterministic: high-cpu → horizontal; high-memory → vertical or fix leak; slow-response → profile first; traffic-spike → auto-scaling.
- Alert levels are fixed: Critical → immediate; Warning → investigate; Info → review daily.
- Troubleshooting priority is fixed: 5 steps in defined order.
- Same context = same recommendations.

#### What Agents May Assume

- Process manager routing follows documented tool selection.
- Monitoring categories cover availability, performance, errors, resources.
- Log types cover application, access, error.
- Health check levels follow simple vs deep.

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- Server already has monitoring configured.
- PM2 is installed on all servers.
- Kubernetes is available for all environments.
- Log rotation is configured by default.

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| Process manager | None; tool recommendation |
| Monitoring | None; strategy guidance |
| Logging | None; principle guidance |
| Scaling | None; strategy recommendation |
| Health check | None; check design |
| Security | None; principle guidance |
| Troubleshoot | None; step-by-step guidance |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Invocation Pattern

```
1. Identify server context (runtime, environment, scale)
2. Invoke process-manager for tool selection
3. Invoke monitoring for alerting strategy
4. Invoke logging for log management
5. Invoke health-check for readiness design
6. Configure and implement (caller's responsibility)
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Each invocation produces a complete recommendation.
- All decisions are independent (can be invoked in any order).

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Unknown runtime | Return error | Specify valid runtime |
| Unknown environment | Return error | Specify valid environment |
| Invalid request type | Return error | Use supported type |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Zero internal retries. Deterministic output.

#### Isolation Model

- Each invocation is stateless and independent.

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Process manager | Yes | Same runtime + env = same tool |
| Monitoring | Yes | Same context = same strategy |
| Scaling | Yes | Same symptom = same strategy |
| Health check | Yes | Same needs = same level |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 2-Phase Lifecycle

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Classify** | Parse runtime, environment, scale, symptom | Classification |
| **Guide** | Generate tool selection, strategy, or troubleshoot steps | Complete output |

All phases synchronous. No async pipeline.

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Process manager routing | Node.js → PM2; Any app → systemd; Containers → Docker/Podman; Orchestration → Kubernetes/Swarm |
| Process goals | 4 goals: restart-on-crash, zero-downtime reload, clustering, persistence |
| Monitoring categories | 4: Availability (uptime, health), Performance (response time, throughput), Errors (rate, types), Resources (CPU, memory, disk) |
| Alert levels | Critical → immediate; Warning → investigate soon; Info → review daily |
| Log types | 3: Application (debug, audit), Access (traffic), Error (issues) |
| Log principles | 4: Rotate to prevent disk fill; Structured (JSON); Appropriate levels; No sensitive data |
| Scaling routing | High CPU → horizontal; High memory → vertical or fix leak; Slow response → profile first; Traffic spikes → auto-scaling |
| Scaling strategies | 3: Vertical (quick fix), Horizontal (sustainable), Auto (variable traffic) |
| Health checks | Simple: return 200; Deep: check all dependencies; Route by load balancer needs |
| Security areas | 5: SSH keys only, minimal ports, patches, env vars for secrets, audit logging |
| Troubleshoot order | 1: Process status; 2: Logs; 3: Resources; 4: Network; 5: Dependencies |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

Stateless. Fully idempotent. No persistent state.

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Unknown runtime | Return `ERR_UNKNOWN_RUNTIME` | Specify nodejs, python, java, or generic |
| Unknown environment | Return `ERR_UNKNOWN_ENVIRONMENT` | Specify bare-metal, vm, container, or kubernetes |
| Invalid request type | Return `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Use supported type |

**Invariant:** Every failure returns a structured error. No partial guidance.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Validation | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_RUNTIME` | Validation | Yes | Runtime not one of 4 |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_ENVIRONMENT` | Validation | Yes | Environment not one of 4 |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_SYMPTOM` | Validation | Yes | Scaling symptom not recognized |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Decision generation | N/A | N/A | Synchronous; < 50ms |
| Internal retries | Zero | Zero | Deterministic output |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema
