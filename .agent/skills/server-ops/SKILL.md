# Server Ops — Production Server Management

> Boring servers = well-managed servers. Auto-restart. Monitor day one. Rotate logs.

## 5 Must-Ask Questions (Before Recommendations)

| # | Question | Options |
|---|----------|---------|
| 1 | Runtime? | Node.js / Python / Java / Generic Linux |
| 2 | Environment? | Bare-metal / VM / Container / Kubernetes |
| 3 | Scale? | Single instance / Small cluster / Large cluster |
| 4 | Symptom? | High CPU / High Memory / Slow Response / Traffic Spike |
| 5 | Current Monitoring? | Yes / No / Partial |

---

## When to Use

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Deploy Node.js app | Use PM2 |
| Server provisioning | Check platform selection |
| High CPU/memory | Follow scaling decisions |
| Server issues | Use 5-step troubleshooting |

---

## System Boundaries

| Owned by This Skill | NOT Owned |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Process manager selection (4 tools) | CI/CD pipelines (→ cicd-pipeline) |
| Monitoring strategy (4 categories) | Observability instrumentation (→ observability) |
| Scaling decisions (3 strategies) | Security scanning (→ security-scanner) |
| Health check design | Command execution |

**Expert decision skill:** Produces management recommendations. Does not execute commands.

---

## Process Manager Selection (Deterministic)

| Scenario | Tool |
|----------|------|
| Node.js app | PM2 (clustering, reload) |
| Any app (Linux) | systemd (native) |
| Containers | Docker / Podman |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes / Swarm |

**4 Goals:** restart-on-crash, zero-downtime reload, clustering, persist across reboot.

---

## Monitoring Strategy (4 Categories × 3 Levels)

| Category | Key Metrics |
|----------|------------|
| Availability | Uptime, health checks |
| Performance | Response time, throughput |
| Errors | Error rate, types |
| Resources | CPU, memory, disk |

| Alert Level | Response |
|-------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Immediate action |
| **Warning** | Investigate soon |
| **Info** | Review daily |

---

## Log Management (3 Types + 4 Principles)

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Application | Debug, audit trail |
| Access | Traffic analysis |
| Error | Issue detection |

**Principles:** Rotate logs, structured JSON, appropriate levels, no sensitive data.

---

## Scaling Decisions (Deterministic)

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| High CPU | Add instances (horizontal) |
| High memory | Increase RAM or fix leak (vertical) |
| Slow response | Profile first, then scale |
| Traffic spikes | Auto-scaling |

| Strategy | When |
|----------|------|
| Vertical | Quick fix, single instance |
| Horizontal | Sustainable, distributed |
| Auto | Variable traffic |

---

## Health Checks (2 Levels)

| Level | Design |
|-------|--------|
| **Simple** | HTTP 200 response |
| **Deep** | Check DB, dependencies, resources |

Route by load balancer needs.

---

## 5-Step Troubleshooting (Fixed Priority)

1. **Process status** — Is it running?
2. **Logs** — Error messages?
3. **Resources** — Disk, memory, CPU?
4. **Network** — Ports, DNS?
5. **Dependencies** — Database, APIs?

---

## Error Taxonomy

| Code | Recoverable | Trigger |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_RUNTIME` | Yes | Runtime not one of 4 |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_ENVIRONMENT` | Yes | Environment not one of 4 |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_SYMPTOM` | Yes | Scaling symptom not recognized |

**Zero internal retries.** Same context = same recommendation.

---

## Audit Logging (OpenTelemetry)

| Event | Metadata Payload | Severity |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| `server_analysis_started` | `{"runtime": "nodejs", "environment": "container"}` | `INFO` |
| `tool_selected` | `{"category": "process_manager", "tool": "docker"}` | `INFO` |
| `scaling_decided` | `{"symptom": "high-cpu", "strategy": "horizontal"}` | `INFO` |
| `analysis_completed` | `{"recommendations_count": 3, "warnings": 1}` | `INFO` |

All server ops outputs MUST emit `server_analysis_started` and `analysis_completed` events.

---

## Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|-------|
| Run as root | Use non-root user |
| Ignore logs | Set up log rotation |
| Skip monitoring | Monitor from day one |
| Manual restarts | Auto-restart configuration |
| No backups | Regular backup schedule |
