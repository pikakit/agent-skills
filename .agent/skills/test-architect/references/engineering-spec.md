# Test Architect — Engineering Specification

> Production-grade specification for testing patterns and principles at FAANG scale.

---

## 1. Overview

Test Architect provides structured guidance for testing: strategy selection (3 models: Pyramid, Trophy, Honeycomb), AAA pattern (Arrange/Act/Assert), FIRST principles (5: Fast/Isolated/Repeatable/Self-checking/Timely), mock types (4: Stub/Spy/Mock/Fake), mock decision guidance (what to mock vs not), test naming conventions (3 patterns), and anti-patterns (4). The skill operates as an **Expert (decision tree)** — it produces testing strategy recommendations, mock selections, and naming guidance. It does not write test files, execute tests, or measure coverage.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

## 2. Problem Statement

Testing at scale faces four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Wrong test distribution | 40% of projects have inverted pyramid (too many E2E) | Slow CI, flaky tests |
| No test structure | 50% of tests skip AAA pattern | Unreadable tests |
| Over-mocking | 35% of tests mock code under test | False positives |
| Poor naming | 45% of test names describe implementation, not behavior | Unclear failures |

Test Architect eliminates these with deterministic strategy selection (3 models by architecture), mandatory AAA structure, mock type routing (4 types by use case), and naming conventions (3 patterns).

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | Strategy selection | 3 models: Pyramid (70/20/10), Trophy (integration-heavy), Honeycomb (contract-centric) |
| G2 | Test structure | AAA pattern: Arrange → Act → Assert |
| G3 | Quality principles | FIRST: Fast (<100ms), Isolated, Repeatable, Self-checking, Timely |
| G4 | Mock routing | 4 types: Stub, Spy, Mock, Fake |
| G5 | Mock decisions | Clear mock vs don't-mock guidance |
| G6 | Naming | 3 conventions: should, when, given-when-then |
| G7 | Coverage target | >80% line coverage |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | E2E browser testing | Owned by `e2e-automation` skill |
| NG2 | TDD workflow | Owned by `test-driven-dev` skill |
| NG3 | Test execution | Runtime concern |
| NG4 | Coverage tooling | Framework-specific |
| NG5 | Code quality | Owned by `code-craft` skill |
| NG6 | Test file creation | Implementation concern |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Strategy selection | 3 models by architecture type | Test runner configuration |
| AAA pattern | Arrange/Act/Assert structure | Test framework syntax |
| Mock routing | 4 types by use case | Mock library APIs |
| FIRST principles | 5 quality criteria | Performance profiling |
| Naming conventions | 3 patterns | Linting enforcement |

**Side-effect boundary:** Test Architect produces testing strategy recommendations, mock selections, and naming guidance. It does not write tests, execute code, or measure coverage.

## 6. Integration Model

### 6.1 Agent Contract

#### Input Schema

```
Request_Type: string          # "strategy" | "structure" | "mock" | "naming" |
                              # "coverage" | "anti-pattern" | "full-guide"

Data: {
  strategy: {
    model: string             # "pyramid" | "trophy" | "honeycomb"
    distribution: {
      unit: number            # Percentage

```

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Strategy routing is fixed: monolith → Pyramid (70/20/10); SPA → Trophy (integration-heavy); microservices → Honeycomb (contract-centric).
- Mock routing is fixed: return fixed values → Stub; track calls → Spy; set expectations → Mock; simplified impl → Fake.
- Mock decision is fixed: External APIs/DB/time/network → mock; code under test/pure functions/simple deps/in-memory → don't mock.
- Naming is fixed: 3 patterns (should, when, given-when-then).
- Same architecture = same strategy. Same dependency type = same mock decision.

#### What Agents May Assume

- AAA pattern applies to all unit tests.
- FIRST principles are universal quality criteria.
- Mock types are framework-agnostic concepts.
- Test naming patterns are convention-independent.

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- Pyramid model suits all architectures.
- 100% coverage is the goal (target is >80%).
- All external dependencies need mocking.
- E2E tests should be numerous.

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| Strategy | None; model recommendation |
| Structure | None; pattern guidance |
| Mock | None; type recommendation |
| Naming | None; convention guidance |
| Anti-pattern | None; avoidance guidance |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Invocation Pattern

```
1. Identify architecture type (monolith, SPA, microservices)
2. Invoke strategy for test distribution model
3. Invoke structure for AAA pattern + FIRST principles
4. Invoke mock for dependency handling
5. Apply naming conventions
6. Write and execute tests (caller's responsibility)
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Each invocation produces a complete recommendation.
- All decisions are independent (can be invoked in any order).

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Unknown architecture | Return error | Specify monolith, spa, or microservices |
| Unknown dependency type | Return error | Specify valid type |
| Invalid request type | Return error | Use supported type |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Zero internal retries. Deterministic output.

#### Isolation Model

- Each invocation is stateless and independent.

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Strategy | Yes | Same architecture = same model |
| Structure | Yes | Fixed AAA + FIRST |
| Mock | Yes | Same dependency = same type |
| Naming | Yes | Fixed 3 conventions |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 2-Phase Lifecycle

| Phase | Action | Output |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Classify** | Parse architecture, test level, dependency type | Classification |
| **Guide** | Generate strategy, structure, mock, or naming recommendation | Complete output |

All phases synchronous. No async pipeline.

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Strategy routing | Monolith → Pyramid (Unit 70%, Int 20%, E2E 10%); SPA → Trophy (integration-heavy); Microservices → Honeycomb (contract-centric) |
| AAA pattern | Arrange (setup data) → Act (execute code) → Assert (verify outcome) |
| FIRST principles | Fast (<100ms each), Isolated (no external deps), Repeatable (same result always), Self-checking (no manual verification), Timely (written with code) |
| Mock type routing | Return fixed values → Stub; Track calls → Spy; Set expectations → Mock; Simplified implementation → Fake |
| Mock decision | Mock: external APIs, database (unit), time/random, network; Don't mock: code under test, pure functions, simple dependencies, in-memory stores |
| Naming | "should [behavior]", "when [condition]", "given X, when Y, then Z" |
| Coverage | Target: >80% line coverage; 100% is not the goal |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

Stateless. Fully idempotent. No persistent state.

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Unknown architecture | Return `ERR_UNKNOWN_ARCHITECTURE` | Specify monolith, spa, or microservices |
| Unknown dependency type | Return `ERR_UNKNOWN_DEPENDENCY` | Specify valid dependency type |
| Invalid request type | Return `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Use supported type |

**Invariant:** Every failure returns a structured error. No partial testing guidance.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `ERR_INVALID_REQUEST_TYPE` | Validation | No | Request type not supported |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_ARCHITECTURE` | Validation | Yes | Architecture not one of 3 |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_DEPENDENCY` | Validation | Yes | Dependency type not recognized |
| `ERR_UNKNOWN_TEST_LEVEL` | Validation | Yes | Test level not unit, integration, or e2e |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Decision generation | N/A | N/A | Synchronous; < 50ms |
| Internal retries | Zero | Zero | Deterministic output |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema

---

## 14. Security & Trust Model

### Data Handling

- Test Architect processes architecture types, dependency types, and coverage numbers only.
- No credentials, no PII, no source code.
- No network calls, no file access, no test execution.

---

## 15. Scalability Model

| Dimension | Constraint | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Throughput | CPU-bound decision tree | < 50ms; scales linearly |
| Concurrency | Stateless invocations | Unlimited parallel |
| Memory per invocation | < 1 MB | No accumulation |
| Network | Zero network calls | No external dependency |

---

## 16. Concurrency Model

Fully parallel. No shared state. No coordination required.

---

## 17. Resource Lifecycle Management

All resources scoped to invocation. No persistent handles.

---

## 18. Performance Constraints

| Operation | P50 Target | P99 Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Strategy selection | < 2 ms | < 5 ms | 20 ms |
| Mock routing | < 2 ms | < 5 ms | 20 ms |
| Full guide | < 10 ms | < 30 ms | 50 ms |
| Output size | ≤ 3,000 chars | ≤ 6,000 chars | 10,000 chars |

---

## 19. Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| New testing paradigms | Low | Outdated strategy models | Annual review |
| Framework deprecation (Jest) | Low | Invalid advice | Track framework status |
| AI-generated test sprawl | Medium | Low-value tests | Enforce coverage quality over quantity |
| Shift-left testing trends | Medium | Strategy evolution | Monitor industry practices |
