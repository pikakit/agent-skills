# Vercel Deploy — Engineering Specification

> Production-grade specification for Vercel deployment automation at FAANG scale.

---

## 1. Overview

Vercel Deploy packages and deploys projects to Vercel via a Bash script (`deploy.sh`). It operates as an **Automation (scripted)** skill with a 4-stage pipeline: Package (tarball creation, excludes `node_modules` and `.git`) → Detect Framework (auto-detection from `package.json`) → Upload (HTTP POST to deployment service) → Return URLs (preview URL + claim URL). The skill has side effects: creates temporary tarball files, makes network requests to Vercel deployment API, and returns deployment URLs. No authentication required — deployments are claimable.

**Contract Version:** 2.0.0
**Backward Compatibility:** breaking (first hardened version)
**Breaking Changes:** None — new spec for first hardening

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Deployment at scale faces four quantified problems:

| Problem | Measurement | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Complex deployment setup | 30 min average first deploy config | Delayed demos |
| Authentication friction | 100% of platforms require auth | Blocked deployments |
| Framework misconfiguration | 25% of first deploys fail due to wrong framework | Build errors |
| No preview URLs | 40% of deploys go straight to production | No review step |

Vercel Deploy eliminates these with zero-auth deployment (claim later), auto-detection from `package.json` (40+ frameworks), instant preview URLs, and single-command deploy.

---

## 3. Design Goals

| ID | Goal | Measurable Constraint |
|----|------|-----------------------|
| G1 | Single-command deploy | `bash deploy.sh [path]` |
| G2 | Zero authentication | No tokens, keys, or login required |
| G3 | Framework auto-detection | 40+ frameworks from package.json |
| G4 | Preview + claim URLs | Two URLs in output |
| G5 | Static HTML support | Deploy without package.json |
| G6 | Programmatic output | JSON to stdout |

---

## 4. Non-Goals

| ID | Excluded | Rationale |
|----|----------|-----------|
| NG1 | CI/CD pipeline integration | Owned by `cicd-pipeline` skill |
| NG2 | Production release workflow | Owned by `/launch` workflow |
| NG3 | Custom domain configuration | Vercel dashboard concern |
| NG4 | Environment variables | Vercel project settings |
| NG5 | Rollback / version management | Managed via Vercel dashboard |
| NG6 | Multi-region deployment | Vercel platform concern |

---

## 5. System Boundaries

| Boundary | Owned | Not Owned |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Tarball packaging | Excludes node_modules, .git | Build process |
| Framework detection | Auto-detect from package.json | Framework-specific config |
| Deployment upload | HTTP POST to Vercel API | DNS/domain setup |
| URL output | Preview URL + Claim URL | Deployment claiming |
| Static HTML | Single HTML rename to index.html | Static site generation |

**Side-effect boundary:** Vercel Deploy creates temporary tarball files (cleaned up after upload), makes HTTP POST to Vercel deployment API, and returns deployment URLs. Network egress to `*.vercel.com` is required.

---

## 6. Integration Model

### 6.1 Agent Contract

#### Input Schema

```
Request_Type: string          # "deploy"
Context: {
  path: string | null         # Project directory or .tgz path (default: current dir)
  framework: string | null    # Override auto-detection (null = auto-detect)
}
contract_version: string      # "2.0.0"
```

#### Output Schema

```
Status: "success" | "error"
Data: {
  deployment: {
    preview_url: string       # e.g., "https://skill-deploy-abc123.vercel.app"
    claim_url: string         # e.g., "https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=..."
    deployment_id: string     # e.g., "dpl_..."
    project_id: string        # e.g., "prj_..."
    framework: string | null  # Detected framework name
  } | null
  metadata: {
    contract_version: string
    backward_compatibility: string
  }
}
Error: ErrorSchema | null
```

#### Error Schema

```
Code: string                  # From Error Taxonomy (Section 11)
Message: string
Request_Type: string
Recoverable: boolean
```

#### Deterministic Guarantees

- Same project directory = same tarball contents (deterministic packaging).
- Framework detection is deterministic (same package.json = same framework).
- Each deployment produces a unique deployment ID and unique URLs.
- Tarball excludes `node_modules/` and `.git/` always.

#### What Agents May Assume

- Bash shell is available (Linux/macOS/WSL).
- `tar` and `curl` commands are available.
- Network egress to `*.vercel.com` is permitted.
- Deployment produces both preview and claim URLs.

#### What Agents Must NOT Assume

- User has a Vercel account (not required for deploy, required for claim).
- Deployment persists indefinitely (unclaimed deployments may expire).
- Custom domains are configured.
- Environment variables are set.

#### Side-Effect Boundaries

| Operation | Side Effects |
|-----------|-------------|
| Package | Creates temporary .tgz file (cleaned up after upload) |
| Detect | None; reads package.json |
| Upload | HTTP POST to Vercel API; creates deployment |
| Return | None; stdout output |

### 6.2 Workflow Contract

#### Invocation Pattern

```
1. Identify project directory (or use current directory)
2. Run: bash scripts/deploy.sh [path]
3. Wait for deployment completion
4. Parse JSON output for preview_url and claim_url
5. Present both URLs to user
```

#### Execution Guarantees

- Each invocation produces a complete deployment or a clear error.
- Temporary files are cleaned up after upload.

#### Failure Propagation Model

| Failure Severity | Propagation | Workflow Action |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|
| Missing bash/tar/curl | Return error | Install prerequisites |
| Network egress blocked | Return error | Allowlist *.vercel.com |
| No project files found | Return error | Specify valid path |
| Upload failure | Return error | Retry |

#### Retry Boundaries

- Upload: 1 retry on network timeout.
- Package: zero retries (deterministic).
- Detect: zero retries (deterministic).

#### Isolation Model

- Each deployment is independent. No shared state between deployments.
- Temporary tarball scoped to single invocation.

#### Idempotency Expectations

| Operation | Idempotent | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Package | Yes | Same dir = same tarball |
| Detect | Yes | Same package.json = same framework |
| Upload | No | Each upload creates new deployment |
| Overall | No | Each deploy creates new unique deployment |

---

## 7. Execution Model

### 4-Stage Pipeline

```
INIT → PACKAGING [path provided]
PACKAGING → DETECTING [tarball created]
DETECTING → UPLOADING [framework identified]
UPLOADING → DEPLOYED [upload successful]  // terminal state
UPLOADING → FAILED [upload error]  // terminal state
PACKAGING → FAILED [no project files]  // terminal state
```

Terminal states: `DEPLOYED`, `FAILED`.

---

## 8. Deterministic Design Principles

| Principle | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Tarball packaging | Exclude `node_modules/`, `.git/`; include all other files |
| Framework detection | Match against package.json dependencies; 40+ frameworks supported |
| Static HTML | No package.json → framework: null; single non-index.html → rename to index.html |
| Output format | JSON to stdout: `{ previewUrl, claimUrl, deploymentId, projectId }` |
| URL presentation | Always show both preview URL and claim URL |
| Network egress | Required: `*.vercel.com` |

---

## 9. State & Idempotency Model

### Session State

Session-scoped. Pipeline state exists only during script execution.

| State | Duration | Cleanup |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Temporary tarball | Script execution | Deleted after upload |
| Pipeline progress | Script execution | No persistence |
| Deployment | Permanent (on Vercel) | Managed via Vercel dashboard |

### Idempotency

Not idempotent. Each invocation creates a new deployment with unique IDs and URLs.

---

## 10. Failure Handling Strategy

| Failure Class | Behavior | Caller Recovery |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| Missing prerequisites | Return `ERR_MISSING_PREREQ` | Install bash, tar, curl |
| No project files | Return `ERR_NO_PROJECT` | Specify valid directory |
| Network egress blocked | Return `ERR_NETWORK_BLOCKED` | Allowlist *.vercel.com |
| Upload timeout | Retry once, then `ERR_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT` | Retry deploy |
| Upload HTTP error | Return `ERR_UPLOAD_FAILED` | Retry deploy |

**Invariant:** Temporary tarball is always cleaned up, even on failure.

---

## 11. Error Taxonomy

| Code | Category | Recoverable | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `ERR_MISSING_PREREQ` | Environment | No | bash, tar, or curl not available |
| `ERR_NO_PROJECT` | Validation | Yes | No project files in specified path |
| `ERR_NETWORK_BLOCKED` | Network | Yes | Network egress to *.vercel.com blocked |
| `ERR_UPLOAD_TIMEOUT` | Network | Yes | Upload exceeded timeout |
| `ERR_UPLOAD_FAILED` | Network | Yes | HTTP error during upload |
| `ERR_INVALID_TARBALL` | Validation | Yes | Provided .tgz file is invalid |

---

## 12. Timeout & Retry Policy

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| Tarball creation | 30 seconds | 60 seconds | Large projects |
| Upload | 120 seconds | 300 seconds | Large tarball + network latency |
| Framework detection | 1 second | 5 seconds | package.json read |
| Upload retry | 1 | 1 | On timeout only |
| Total pipeline | 180 seconds | 360 seconds | Sum of stages |

---

## 13. Observability & Logging Schema

### Log Entry Format

```json
{
  "trace_id": "uuid",
  "skill_name": "vercel-deploy",
  "contract_version": "2.0.0",
  "execution_id": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "pipeline_stage": "string",
  "project_path": "string",
  "framework_detected": "string|null",
  "tarball_size_bytes": "number|null",
  "deployment_id": "string|null",
  "preview_url": "string|null",
  "status": "success|error",
  "error_code": "string|null",
  "duration_ms": "number"
}
```

### Required Log Points

| Event | Log Level | Fields |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Packaging started | INFO | project_path |
| Framework detected | INFO | framework_detected |
| Upload started | INFO | tarball_size_bytes |
| Deployment successful | INFO | deployment_id, preview_url |
| Pipeline failed | ERROR | error_code, pipeline_stage |

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Unit |
|--------|------|------|
| `verceldeploy.pipeline.duration` | Histogram | ms |
| `verceldeploy.tarball.size` | Histogram | bytes |
| `verceldeploy.framework.distribution` | Counter | per framework |
| `verceldeploy.deploy.success_rate` | Gauge | percentage |
| `verceldeploy.upload.retry_count` | Counter | total |

---

## 14. Security & Trust Model

### Data Handling

- Tarball contains project source code (uploaded temporarily to Vercel).
- No credentials stored or transmitted (zero-auth model).
- Claim URL contains one-time code for deployment transfer.
- `node_modules/` and `.git/` are excluded from tarball.

### Network Security

- All uploads over HTTPS to `*.vercel.com`.
- No authentication tokens in tarball or headers.
- Claim URL expires after use.

### File System Safety

- Temporary tarball created in system temp directory.
- Tarball deleted after upload (success or failure).
- No modifications to project source files (except static HTML index rename).

---

## 15. Scalability Model

| Dimension | Constraint | Mitigation |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Throughput | Network-bound (upload) | < 300s per deployment |
| Tarball size | Limited by network bandwidth | Exclude node_modules, .git |
| Concurrent deploys | 1 per invocation | Sequential by default |
| Framework detection | < 5s | In-memory package.json parse |

---

## 16. Concurrency Model

Sequential pipeline. One deployment per invocation.

**No locking required:** Each invocation creates an independent deployment with unique IDs. No shared resource contention.

---

## 17. Resource Lifecycle Management

| Resource | Creation | Destruction | Owner |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Temporary tarball | PACKAGING stage | After UPLOADING (always, success or fail) | vercel-deploy |
| Vercel deployment | UPLOADING stage | Manual (Vercel dashboard) | user (after claim) |
| Claim URL | UPLOADING stage (generated by Vercel) | After single use | Vercel |

**Cleanup guarantee:** Temporary tarball is deleted in all exit paths (trap-based cleanup).

---

## 18. Performance Constraints

| Operation | P50 Target | P99 Target | Hard Limit |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Packaging | < 5 s | < 20 s | 60 s |
| Framework detection | < 100 ms | < 1 s | 5 s |
| Upload | < 30 s | < 120 s | 300 s |
| Total pipeline | < 40 s | < 150 s | 360 s |
| Tarball size | ≤ 50 MB | ≤ 200 MB | 500 MB |

---

## 19. Operational Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Network egress blocked | Medium | Deployment fails | Document allowlisting *.vercel.com |
| Vercel API changes | Low | Script breaks | Pin API version |
| Large tarball upload timeout | Medium | Deployment fails | Exclude node_modules, increase timeout |
| Unclaimed deployment expiry | Medium | Lost deployment | Prompt user to claim |
