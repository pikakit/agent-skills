# /game - Game Development

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Purpose

Orchestrate game development from concept to published game — routing to platform-specific engines, implementing core game loops, managing asset pipelines, and handling multiplayer networking. **Differs from `/build` (general web/mobile apps) by focusing on game-specific concerns: frame budgets, physics, ECS architecture, networking models, and store submission.** Uses `game-development` with `game-development` skill, coordinated by `orchestrator` for parallel art + audio + code pipelines.

## 🤖 Meta-Agents Integration

| Phase | Agent | Action |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| **Pre-Flight** | `assessor` | Evaluate scope, risks, and knowledge-compiler patterns |
| **Execution** | `orchestrator` | Coordinate parallel tasks (art, audio, code) |
| **Safety** | `recovery` | Save checkpoint before major game logic changes |
| **Conflict** | `critic` | Resolve design vs performance trade-offs |
| **Post-Build** | `learner` | Log game patterns for reuse |

```
Flow:
assessor.evaluate(scope, platform) → recovery.save()       ↓
orchestrator.parallel(art, audio, code)
       → conflict
critic.resolve(design_vs_perf)       ↓
verify → learner.log(patterns)
```

## Platform Routing

| Target | Engine | Sub-Skill |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Web | Phaser / PixiJS / Three.js | `game-development` (web) |
| Mobile | Unity / Godot | `game-development` (mobile) |
| PC | Unity / Godot / Unreal | `game-development` (PC) |
| VR/AR | Unity XR / A-Frame | `game-development` (VR/AR) |

| Dimension | Key Concerns |
|-----------|-------------|
| 2D | Sprite batching, atlas, tile maps |
| 3D | LOD, occlusion culling, lighting |

## ⚡ MANDATORY: Game Development Protocol

### Phase 1: Pre-flight & knowledge-compiler Context

> **Rule 0.5-K:** knowledge-compiler pattern check.

1. Read `.agent/skills/knowledge-compiler/patterns/` for past failures before proceeding.
2. Trigger `recovery` agent to run Checkpoint (`git commit -m "chore(checkpoint): pre-game"`).

### Phase 2: Requirements & Scope

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **INPUT** | $ARGUMENTS (game concept description) |
| **OUTPUT** | Game design doc: platform, dimension, genre, multiplayer model, target FPS |
| **AGENTS** | `project-planner`, `assessor` |
| **SKILLS** | `game-development`, `idea-storm`, `context-engineering` |

1. Ask critical questions:

| Question | Options | Impact |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Platform? | Web / Mobile / PC / Console / VR-AR | Engine + build pipeline |
| Dimension? | 2D / 2.5D / 3D | Rendering pipeline |
| Genre? | Platformer / Puzzle / Shooter / RPG / Sandbox | Core mechanics |
| Multiplayer? | Solo / Local co-op / Online PvP / MMO | Networking stack |
| Target FPS? | 30 / 60 / 120 | Performance budget |

2. `assessor` evaluates scope and platform risks
3. Select engine and architecture pattern

### Phase 3: Core Game Loop & Architecture

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **INPUT** | Game design doc from Phase 2 |
| **OUTPUT** | Game loop implementation, architecture scaffold |
| **AGENTS** | `orchestrator`, `game-development` |
| **SKILLS** | `game-development`, `smart-router` |

1. Implement fixed timestep game loop:

| Target | Budget/Frame | Breakdown |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **60 FPS** | 16.67ms | Input 1ms  Physics 3ms  AI 2ms  Logic 4ms  Render 5ms |
| **30 FPS** | 33.33ms | Input 1ms  Physics 5ms  AI 5ms  Logic 10ms  Render 10ms |

2. Select architecture pattern:

| Pattern | Use When |
|---------|----------|
| **State Machine** | 3-5 discrete states (Idle?Run?Jump) |
| **Object Pooling** | Frequent spawn/destroy (bullets, particles) |
| **ECS** | Thousands of similar entities |
| **Behavior Tree** | Complex AI decisions |

3. Abstract input layer (keyboard → gamepad → touch)

### Phase 4: Asset Pipeline & Audio

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **INPUT** | Architecture scaffold from Phase 3 |
| **OUTPUT** | Optimized assets in `assets/`, audio system |
| **AGENTS** | `game-development` |
| **SKILLS** | `game-development` |

1. Set up asset directory structure and optimization targets:

| Asset | Optimization | Target |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Sprites | Texture atlasing | <40964096 per atlas |
| 3D Models | LOD, mesh simplification | <10K tris (mobile) |
| Audio SFX | Mono, 22kHz, OGG | <100KB per sound |
| Shaders | GPU-efficient | Platform-appropriate |

2. Audio system: pool sources (max 32), priority UI > Player > Enemies > Ambient

### Phase 5: Multiplayer & Networking (if applicable)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **INPUT** | Multiplayer model from Phase 2 design doc |
| **OUTPUT** | Networking layer, lobby system, anti-cheat |
| **AGENTS** | `game-development`, `nodejs-pro` |
| **SKILLS** | `game-development` |

| Model | Use When | Complexity |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Lock-step** | Turn-based, RTS | Low |
| **Client-server** | FPS, action, MMO | High |
| **Client prediction** | Fast-paced PvP | Very high |
| **Relay (P2P)** | Co-op, casual | Medium |

Networking checklist:
- [ ] State serialization / delta compression
- [ ] Client prediction + server reconciliation
- [ ] Lobby + matchmaking
- [ ] Anti-cheat (server-authoritative)
- [ ] Graceful disconnect / reconnection

### Phase 6: Build & Export

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **INPUT** | Complete game from Phases 3-5 |

| Web | Vite / esbuild | itch.io / Newgrounds |
| Android | Gradle / Unity | Google Play |
| iOS | Xcode / Unity | App Store |
| Windows | Electron / Unity / Godot | Steam |

Optimization: Tree shake → Minify → Compress assets → Code split → CDN

### Phase 7: Testing & Verification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **INPUT** | Built game from Phase 6 |
| **OUTPUT** | Test results: FPS, memory, platform compatibility |
| **AGENTS** | `test-architect`, `learner` |
| **SKILLS** | `game-development`, `perf-optimizer`, `problem-checker`, `knowledge-compiler` |

Test checklist:
- [ ] Maintains target FPS on lowest-spec device
- [ ] No memory leaks after 10+ minutes
- [ ] Works on all target platforms
- [ ] Input responsive (<100ms lag)
- [ ] Save/load works correctly
- [ ] Multiplayer sync verified (if applicable)

## → MANDATORY: Problem Verification Before Completion

> **CRITICAL:** This check MUST be performed before any `notify_user` or task completion.

### Check @[current_problems]

```
1. Read @[current_problems] from IDE
2. If errors/warnings > 0:
   a. Auto-fix: imports, types, lint errors
   b. Re-check @[current_problems]
   c. If still > 0 → STOP → Notify user
3. If count = 0 → Proceed to completion
```

### Auto-Fixable

| Type | Fix |
|------|-----|
| Missing import | Add import statement |
| Unused variable | Remove or prefix `_` |
| Type mismatch | Fix type annotation |
| Lint errors | Run eslint --fix |

> **Rule:** Never mark complete with errors in `@[current_problems]`.

---

## 🔄 Rollback & Recovery

If game loop, physics engine, or multiplayer netcode breaks functionality:
1. Restore to pre-game checkpoint (`git checkout -- .` or `git stash pop`).
2. Log architecture failure via `learner` meta-agent.
3. Bring in `critic` to evaluate trade-offs before retrying implementation.

## Examples

```
/game 2D platformer for web browser with Phaser
/game mobile puzzle game with Unity and Google Play submission
/game 3D RPG with online multiplayer support
/game retro arcade game with leaderboard
/game multiplayer shooter with client prediction
```

---

## Key Principles

- **Profile before optimizing** — measure with profiler, don't guess bottlenecks
- **Data-driven design** — levels, configs, and balancing in JSON, not hardcoded
- **Abstract input** — map actions to inputs, support keyboard + gamepad + touch
- **Object pooling** — never create/destroy in hot loops, pool everything
- **Fixed timestep** — deterministic physics separate from render framerate
