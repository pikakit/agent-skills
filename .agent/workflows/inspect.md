# /inspect - Defense-in-Depth Review

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Purpose

Systematic code review with multi-layer validation — preventing false completion claims through evidence-based verification across build, tests, security, and logic layers. **Differs from `/validate` (runs tests) and `/diagnose` (finds bugs) by performing comprehensive quality audit across all dimensions before deployment.** Uses `security-scanner` with `security-scanner` for vulnerability scanning and `code-review` for quality validation.

---

## Sub-Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/inspect` | Review current changes |
| `/inspect [file-path]` | Review specific file |
| `/inspect --pr` | PR-style review |
| `/inspect --security` | Security-focused review |

---

## 🤖 Meta-Agents Integration

| Phase | Agent | Action |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| **Pre-Flight** | `assessor` | Evaluate review scope, risks and knowledge-compiler patterns |
| **Execution** | `orchestrator` | Coordinate 4-layer validation sequence |
| **Safety** | `recovery` | Save workspace checkpoint before validation |
| **Post-Review** | `learner` | Log review patterns for future reference |

```
Flow:
assessor.evaluate(scope) → 4-layer validation       ↓
build → tests → security → logic       ↓
report → learner.log(patterns)
```

---

## ⚡ MANDATORY: 4-Layer Validation Protocol

### Phase 1: Pre-flight & knowledge-compiler Context

> **Rule 0.5-K:** knowledge-compiler pattern check.

1. Read `.agent/skills/knowledge-compiler/patterns/` for past failures before proceeding.
2. Trigger `recovery` agent to run Checkpoint (`git commit -m "chore(checkpoint): pre-inspect"`).

### Phase 2: Build Verification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **INPUT** | $ARGUMENTS (target files/scope or current changes) |
| **OUTPUT** | Build result: compilation status, lint errors, warnings |
| **AGENTS** | `orchestrator`, `assessor` |
| **SKILLS** | `code-review`, `context-engineering` |

// turbo — telemetry: phase-2-build
```bash
npx cross-env OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="workflow:inspect" TRACE_ID="$TRACE_ID" npm run build
```

| Check | Required |
|-------|----------|
| TypeScript compiles | → |
| No lint errors | → |
| No warnings | ?? |

### Phase 3: Test Verification

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **INPUT** | Build result from Phase 2 |
| **OUTPUT** | Test result: pass/fail count, coverage, skipped tests |
| **AGENTS** | `orchestrator` |
| **SKILLS** | `code-review` |

// turbo — telemetry: phase-3-test
```bash
npx cross-env OTEL_SERVICE_NAME="workflow:inspect" TRACE_ID="$TRACE_ID" npm test
```

| Check | Required |
|-------|----------|
| All tests pass | → |
| No skipped tests | ?? |
| Coverage maintained | ?? |

### Phase 4: Security Scan

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **INPUT** | Source files in scope |
| **OUTPUT** | Security report: vulnerabilities found, severity levels |
| **AGENTS** | `security-scanner` |
| **SKILLS** | `security-scanner`, `code-review` |

| Check | Required |
|-------|----------|
| No hardcoded secrets | → |
| Input validation present | → |
| SQL injection safe | → |
| XSS prevention | → |

### Phase 5: Logic Review

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **INPUT** | All results from Phases 2-4 + source code |
| **OUTPUT** | Logic review: issues found with severity, required actions |
| **AGENTS** | `security-scanner`, `learner` |
| **SKILLS** | `code-review`, `problem-checker`, `knowledge-compiler` |

| Category | Questions |
|----------|----------|
| **Correctness** | Does it solve the stated problem? |
| **Edge Cases** | Null, empty, max values handled? |
| **Error Handling** | All failure modes covered? |
| **Performance** | N+1 queries? Memory leaks? |
| **Maintainability** | Clear naming? Single responsibility? |

## → MANDATORY: Problem Verification Before Completion

> **CRITICAL:** This check MUST be performed before any `notify_user` or task completion.

### Check @[current_problems]

```
1. Read @[current_problems] from IDE
2. If errors/warnings > 0:
   a. Auto-fix: imports, types, lint errors
   b. Re-check @[current_problems]
   c. If still > 0 → STOP → Notify user
3. If count = 0 → Proceed to completion
```

### Auto-Fixable

| Type | Fix |
|------|-----|
| Missing import | Add import statement |
| Unused variable | Remove or prefix `_` |
| Lint errors | Run eslint --fix |

> **Rule:** Never mark complete with errors in `@[current_problems]`.

---

## 🔄 Rollback & Recovery

If the inspection process (builds, scans) creates ghost artifacts or fails to complete legitimately:
1. Restore workspace to pre-inspect checkpoint (`git reset --hard HEAD` and `git clean -fd`).
2. Log failure via `learner` meta-agent.
3. Automatically escalate to `/diagnose` to understand why the pipeline failed.

---

### Evidence-Based Completion

**NEVER claim completion without proof:**

```
? CORRECT: "Build passed: `npm run build` completed in 3.2s"
? CORRECT: "Tests: 42/42 passed (npm test output attached)"
? WRONG:  "I believe the code should work"
? WRONG:  "This should fix the issue"
```

---

## Output Format

```markdown
## ?? Inspect: [Target]

### Layer Results

| Layer | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Build | → Pass | 0 errors, 2 warnings |
| Tests | → Pass | 42/42 passed, 78% coverage |
| Security | ?? Warning | 1 issue found |
| Logic | ?? Issues | 3 issues found |

### Issues Found

| File | Issue | Severity |
|------|-------|----------|
| `user.ts:45` | Missing null check | High |
| `api.ts:23` | No rate limiting | Medium |
| `auth.ts:89` | Unused variable | Low |

### Verdict

?? **NEEDS FIXES** before completion

### Required Actions

1. Add null check in user.ts:45
2. Add CSRF token to POST endpoints
3. Consider rate limiting

### Next Steps

- [ ] Fix identified issues with `/fix`
- [ ] Re-run `/inspect` after fixes
- [ ] Run `/validate` for full test suite
```

---

## Examples

```
/inspect
/inspect src/services/auth.ts
/inspect --pr
/inspect --security
/inspect src/routes/ --security
```

---

## Key Principles

- **Evidence over belief** — prove it works with command output, not assumptions
- **Every layer matters** — don't skip build, tests, security, or logic checks
- **Security first** — always scan for vulnerabilities before marking complete
- **Fix before claiming** — no "should work" — verify with evidence
- **Document issues** — clear action items with file, line, and severity

| Issues found | `/fix` | Fix identified issues |
| All clear | `/validate` | Run full test suite |
| Security issue | `/diagnose` | Deep investigation |

**Handoff to /fix:**

```markdown
?? Review complete. [X] issues found across 4 layers.
Verdict: [PASS/NEEDS FIXES]. Run `/fix` to resolve or `/validate` if all clear.
